While in response to conscious experiences, arising due to sensory stimulation, neural assemblies are formed, conscious experience is itself an outcome of sustained synchronous firing of a neural assembly. This leads to a paradoxical situation or Neural Development Paradox - what comes first: the conscious experience or the neural assembly? To have zero-lag synchronous activity amongst neurons of an assembly, which is needed for binding individual responses into a conscious percept, we need a very rapid source of communication between them. Axonal conduction delays amounting to several tens of milliseconds cannot account for the zero-lag synchrony across spatially separated brain areas, which is required for STDP Hebbian learning to hardwire a neural assembly. Hence, an alternate means of instantaneous communication needs to be explored. According to the Penrose-Hameroff Quantum Approach towards consciousness, the microtubule cytoskeleton acts as a quantum computer whose collapsed states are conscious experiences manifesting in the form of an activated neural assembly. Neurons, whose microtubules are entangled, get connected by means of gap junctions, behaving like one giant neuron, firing in synchrony, seemingly breaking the Neural Development Paradox. By mental force of directed attention, Quantum Zeno Effect can be instigated, as suggested by Von Neumann-Stapp, causing the activated state of the brain to stabilize till Hebbian learning strengthens the synaptic connections, giving way to a quantum explanation for the formation of neural assemblies, both intra-modality as well as inter-modality. In this paper we report our efforts towards building a simulation-mathematical model of Quantum-Hebbian Learning that attempts to interface classical Hebbian learning with quantum theoretic mechanisms of conscious experience to develop neural assemblies. Under the influence of the modulatory mental force of directed attention, the model is also able to address high level issues like mind wandering, zombie modes, volition etc. The model is an attempt to study the benefits of introducing the concept of duality in the formation of neural assemblies and understand how consciousness and attention influence the development of the brain.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Study of the cognitive neuroscientific basis of general anesthesia involves evaluation of the effect of anesthetic agents on consciousness and the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive function. Central nervous system dysfunction after anesthesia and/or surgery can occur at any age but is a particular issue for elderly patients. Studies of delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have been published in many countries since the end of the last century. We present a discussion of delirium disorders and a review of the literature.|Case Report: We also present case reports for 2 patients who underwent general surgery for epilepsy. The first patient experienced postoperative visual illusions, hallucination, and time and space disorientation. The second patient, experienced a postoperative zombie-like delirium state. The status of both patients was improved ill response to treatment with methylprednisolone. The first patient also received amantadine sulfate, and the second patient received antiepileptic drugs.|Conclusions: The brain is the main target organ for anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and age-associated changes in the brain have important implications with respect to general anesthesia. Anesthetists and surgeons have suspected for many years that some patients suffer a postoperative decline in cognitive function. The condition generally has a good outcome because oxidative nerve cell derangements and neurotransmitter imbalances are transient.","","19396043","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

In the young brain, amyloid beta-(1-42) (A beta 42) is a normal aggregation-prone protein product of neuronal activity that is kept at a safe low level by proteolysis in neurons and glial cells, and by expulsion across the blood-brain barrier. But clearance declines with advancing age. Step 1: Because of the normal decline with age of the A beta 42-clearing mechanisms, toxic amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) made of dodecamers of the aggregation-prone A beta 42 start accumulating. These A beta 42 dodecamers selectively target the initially huge numbers of excitatory synapses of neurons and cause them to start slowly dropping, which increasingly impairs plasticity and sooner or later starts noticeably affecting memory formation. At a certain point, this increasing loss of synapses induces the neurons to redirect their still-expressed cell cycle proteins from post-mitotic jobs, such as maintaining synapses, to starting a cell cycle and partially or completely replicating DNA without entering mitosis. The resulting aneuploid or tetraploid neurons survive for as long as 6-12 months as quasi-functional 'undead zombies', with developing tangles of hyperphosphorylated T protein disrupting the vital anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria and other synapse-vital components. Step 2: The hallmark AD plaques appear as A beta 42 clearance continues to decline and the formation of A beta 42 non-diffusible fibrils be-ins in the aging brain. Step 3: A terminal cytokine-driven maelstrom begins in the aging brain when micro-glia, the brain's professional macrophages, are activated in and around the plaques. They produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. One of these, IFN-gamma, causes the astrocytes enwrapping the neuronal synapses to express their beta-secretase (BACE1) genes and produce and release A beta 42, which can kill the closely apposed neurons by binding to their p75(NTR) receptors, which generate apoptogenic signals. Astrocytes are also stimulated by the same cytokines to turn oil their nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 genes and start pouring large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and its cytocidal derivative peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) directly Out onto the closely apposed neurons.","","21479393","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6"

With the microblog network model and the zombie- city model, this paper has modelled an artificial microblog and has simulated the information dissemination in the artificial microblog with different scenes. Therefore, some interesting findings have been presented. (1) Due to a better connectivity, information could spread widely in a random network; (2) information spreads more quickly in a stable microblog network; (3) the decay rate of the relationships will have an effect on information dissemination; that is, with a lower decay rate, information spreads more quickly and widely; (4) the higher active level of users in microblog could promote information spread widely and quickly; (5) the ""@"" mode of information dissemination makes a high modularity of the information diffusion network.","1563-5147","","10.1155/2014/492753","","","","492753","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

This will help us to drive supplementary active measurements to characterize the strength and characteristic of attacks to improve correlation of our log data and with other publicly available network traffic analysis data. Secondly, we presented a monitoring scheme to simulate a variety of attacks on different mobile operating system. This will identify the potential threat of different DDoS attacks for such platform and traffic scanning activity to avoid detection of attacks such as Ping to Death DDoS attack. Third, we followed proceedings of an enduring basis to extort trends in the attack frequency, make-up, and production of extensive DDoS attacks.

While the campaign was extremely popular, we examined the question of whether the campaign had the capability to translate into knowledge and action.|Methods. We conducted an online experiment with 340 undergraduate students divided randomly into two groups. One group was exposed to CDC's zombie blog post; the other to the same preparedness information presented in CDC's traditional, straightforward way. Participants then completed a survey designed to gauge their affective feelings, perceptions, retention of preparedness preparation, and intent to develop an emergency kit and plan.|Results. While participants who viewed the humorous zombie material clearly enjoyed it, their positive affect did not lead to greater retention of preparedness information or greater expressed intent to prepare, compared with participants exposed to the factual treatment. The zombie approach had no influence on retention or resulted in less retention relative to the factual approach. Also, there was no significant between-group difference in reported likelihood of developing an emergency kit or plan.|Conclusion. While the campaign drew unprecedented traffic to CDC's website, our findings suggest that it lacked the capability to fully achieve the agency's goals of educating people about preparedness and prompting them to get ready. This finding supports previous studies concluding that it is challenging to design public health messages that evoke positive affect as well as intended changes in intentions or behaviors.","","26556937","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Though we use real-time traffic data to calculate the mean and variance, few periods of data need to be stored because the algorithm is a recurring process, therefore the occupied storage space is less. Moreover, the complex and cost of the recurring process is less than calculating the whole sequence, so the load of the server would not increase much. Although we focus our research on detecting flooding-based DoS/DDoS attacks, the simulation shows that the approach also can deal with DDoS attacks that zombies start without simultaneousness.","","","","","","","","Yoshiura, H|Sakurai, K|Rannenberg, K|Murayama, Y|Kawamura, S","LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE","1st International Workshop on Security (IWSEC 2006)","OCT 23-24, 2006","Kyoto, JAPAN","Inst Elect Informat & Commun Engineers ISEC, Informat Proc Soc Japan Comp Security, CSEC SIG","3-540-47699-7","","","","","","","","3"

A lot of cyber attacks are launched by botnets including DDoS, spamming, click frauds and information thefts. Despite of numerous methods have been proposed to detect botnets, botnet detection is still a challenging issue, as adversaries are constantly improving bots to write them stealthier. Existing anomaly-based detection mechanisms, particularly network-based approaches, are not sufficient to defend sophisticated botnets since they are too heavy or generate non-negligible amount of false alarms. As well, tracing attack sources is hardly achieved by existing mechanisms due to the pervasive use of source concealment techniques, such as an IP spoofing and a malicious proxy. In this paper, we propose a host-based mechanism to detect bots at the attack source. We monitor non-human generated attack traffics and trace their corresponding processes. The proposed mechanism effectively detects malicious bots irrespective of their structural characteristics. It can protect networks and system resources by shutting down attack traffics at the attack source. We evaluate our mechanism with eight real-life bot codes that have distinctive architectures, protocols and attack modules. In experimental results, our mechanism effectively detects bot processes in around one second after launching flood attacks or sending spam mails, while no false alarm is generated.","","","","","","","","Bao, F|Weng, J","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","7th International Conference on Information Security Practice and|Experience (ISPEC)","MAY 30-JUN 01, 2011","Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA","Jinan Univ, Dept Comp Sci","978-3-642-21031-0","Jinan Univ","","","","","","","3"

Drawing on research in Hull, Hackney and Bristol during 2010 and 2011 for the Cycling Cultures research project, we describe a range of 'sensory strategies' enrolled by cyclists. Our research reveals how sensory strategies, such as using mobile audio devices, involve deliberate and finely tuned practices shaped by factors such as relaxation, motivation and location. This presents a contrast to media representations of the 'iPod zombie cyclist' who, plugged into a mobile audio device, lumbers insensitively and dangerously through the urban landscape. The article complicates the idea that sensory practices of listening and not-listening are two fixed and distinct ways of being in the urban environment. We suggest that considering the sensory strategies of cyclists opens up a new terrain for thinking about less easily represented, uncertain and fleeting intersections of mobility, place and the senses. Ultimately, we argue that an analysis of cycling's sensory strategies might enrich our understanding of mobility cultures by operating to reconnect a range of mobile citizens with the broader messy and less easily controllable sensory landscape. This has implications both for understanding cycling as a sensory practice and for thinking about how the sensory dimensions of other mobile practices are shaped by practitioners.","1745-011X","","10.1080/17450101.2013.796772","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

We propose the Zmail protocol as a way to preserve email as a ""free"" common resource for most users, while imposing enough cost on bulk mailers so that market forces will control the volume of spam. A key idea behind Zmail is that the most important resource consumed by email is not the transmission process but the end user's attention. Zmail requires the sender of an email to pay a small amount (called an ""e-penny"") which is paid directly to the receiver of the email.|Zmail is thus a ""zero-sum"" email protocol. Users who receive as much email as they send, on average, will neither pay nor profit from email, once they have set up initial balances with their ESPs (Email Service Providers) to buffer the fluctuations. Spammers will incur costs that will moderate their behavior. Importantly, Zmail requires no definition of what is and is not spam, so spammers' efforts to evade such definitions become irrelevant. We describe methods within Zmail for supporting ""free"" goods such as volunteer mailing lists, and for limiting exploitation by email viruses and zombies.|Zmail is not a micro-payment scheme among end-users. It is an accounting relationship among ""compliant ESPs"", which reconcile payments to and from their users. Zmail can be implemented on top of the existing SMTP email protocol. We describe an incremental deployment strategy that can start with as few as two compliant ESPs and provides positive feedback for growth as Zmail spreads over the Internet.","","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.144","","","","","","","25th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","JUN 06-10, 2005","Columbus, OH","IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc","0-7695-2328-5","","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","4"

The particular features of the crisis regime dedicated to assessing State Aid not only allowed the disbursement of unprecedented amounts of aid, often in record time, but also rendered the aid more effective by ensuring that aid recipients, where necessary, were restructured or liquidated. The conditions imposed on banks receiving large amounts of aid have generally led to highly significant restructuring and addressed fundamental weaknesses in business models, helping to avoid the creation of ""zombie banks."" At the same time, where aid amounts were relatively small and banks were sound, these rules allowed financial institutions to be aided without requiring changes in their business model.|SA control has ensured that the large amounts of aid granted did not lead to major distortions in the Internal Market. Absent this control, these public interventions could have triggered a fragmentation of the Internal Market itself.|While all substantial aid is likely to have a distortive effect, available indicators suggest that SA control has effectively mitigated these consequences. There is little evidence of retrenchment behind national borders and aided banks have generally not seen their market shares increase. Moreover, the crisis framework is likely to have had a strong signalling function to financial institutions with respect to moral hazard going forward.|In the absence of EU-wide rules for bank resolution, the SA crisis regime also presently acts as the de facto EU-wide resolution framework. However, it is an imperfect tool resolution compared to a full-fledged regulatory framework that helps avoid recourse to aid in the first instance and can provide clear ex ante guidance for all market players (which in itself is confidence-enhancing).|The re-emergence of serious tensions in the EU banking sector from the summer of 2011 onwards is largely linked to concerns about the sustainability of public finances in a number of EU Member States feeding through to concerns about assets on banks' balance sheets. To remedy this, stability-oriented macroeconomic--especially fiscal-policies are required, and appropriate regulation of banking is needed. A key challenge for State Aid control in EU banking, therefore, is to ensure appropriate coordination with regulatory and macroeconomic policies as they are further developed.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In these narratives we are re-introduced to the zombie not as a metaphor for lost consciousness, but, rather, as a common system that replaces personal subjectivity with an influence alien to our natural development. The discourse on subjectivity has become a central focus in the modern era but attention to fiction in ""third world"" cultures is neglected because they are studied almost exclusively through historical, political, sociological, or anthropological lenses or because their collective identities leads scholars to assume they had not developed consciousness of individual subjectivity. ""Third world"" cultures, however, are addressing the subject and Thomas discusses the zombie as one expression that focuses on the validity of subjectivity. Further, although zombies have been part of the Western imagination for nearly a century, scholars have not studied the zombie in terms of its mythological components. The myth of the zombie reveals a process that combines the dynamic power of a leader, the community, and the individual or victim. Thomas's analysis emphasizes how zombification challenges the notion that there exists an invulnerable, continuous, self-possessed subjectivity in humans.","","","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

However, if we take intentions, beliefs, or mental representations all to instantiate some mental properties, then the more basic issue regarding such collective engagements is what it is for groups of individual minds to share a mind. Somewhat surprisingly, this very issue has not received much attention in the respective debates and when it has, typically the outlook has been skeptical or outright negative. In this paper, I argue that it is epistemologically possible for a group of individuals to literally share a single mental unit.

However, a ""type-Q'' materialist approach, inspired by Quinean suspicions about a priority and modal entailment, rejects the sharp line between empirical and conceptual truths needed for the traditional responses. In this paper, I develop a type-Q response to the zombie argument, one stressing the theory-laden nature of our conceivability and possibility intuitions. I argue that our first-person access to the conscious mind systematically misleads us into thinking that the distinctive qualities of conscious experience-qualia-are nonfunctional. Qualia, I contend, are functional, even though they do not seem to be. To support my claim, I introduce the ""meditations'' of Rene Descartes' zombie twin. This establishes the plausibility of an appearance/reality distinction for consciousness and it undermines various anti-materialist objections based on privileged first-person access. I conclude that the best overall theory posits an appearance/reality distinction for qualia, and this, for the type-Q materialist, is decisive.","","","10.1080/09515089.2011.562646","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

As a consequence, this epistemology can't justify our quotidian judgments of possibility, let alone those judgments that concern the mind/body connection. Working from the analogy that the imagination is to the possible as perception is to the actual, I set forth a competing epistemology, 'modal empiricism.'

In the real world it looks more like most scientists are quite willing to pursue wrong ideas for so tong as they are rewarded with a better chance of achieving more grants, publications and status. The classic account has it that bogus theories should readily be demolished by sceptical (or jealous) competitor scientists. However, in practice even the most conclusive 'hatchet jobs' may fail to kill, or even weaken, phoney hypotheses when they are backed-up with sufficient economic muscle in the form of lavish and sustained funding. And when a branch of science based on phoney theories serves a useful but non-scientific purpose, it may be kept-going indefinitely by continuous transfusions of cash from those whose interests it serves. If this happens, real science expires and a 'zombie science' evolves. Zombie science is science that is dead but will not lie down. It keeps twitching and lumbering around so that (from a distance, and with your eyes half-closed) zombie science looks much like the real thing. But in fact the zombie has no life of its own; it is animated and moved only by the incessant pumping of funds. If zombie science is not scientificalty-useable - what is its function? In a nutshell, zombie science is supported because it is useful propaganda to be deployed in arenas such as political rhetoric, public administration, management, public relations, marketing and the mass media generally. It persuades, it constructs taboos, it buttresses some kind of rhetorical attempt to shape mass opinion. Indeed, zombie science often comes across in the mass media as being more plausible than real science; and it is precisely the superficial face-plausibility which is the sole and sufficient purpose of zombie science.

Those creative processes are remarkably similar whether engaged in by academics or by those outside the academy. Instead, students may encounter the same formulaic processes and products required in K-12 schools, with little opportunity to learn how to be genuinely engaged intellectually. Results of the United States High School Survey of Student Engagement (HSSSE) conducted with 81,000 students revealed that seventy-five percent reported being bored in class (Yazzie-Mintz, 2007). This is a worldwide problem. In a 2003-04 survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment of seventeen million fifteen-year-olds in thirty-two countries, forty-eight percent of them reported school boredom (OECD, 2004).|This paper describes a culturally-sensitive autoethnographic research methodology called The Collectory based on the themes of fun in learning and related attentional skills of interest (Zinn 2004, 2008). The Collectory is a philosophical approach to research that puts the learner at the center of the exploration, broadening processes to include nontraditional sources, expanding product possibilities, and making the researcher's reflective, connective, and interdisciplinary thinking an integral part of the collection and presentation of information. It also allows for new models of expression, including ""self-sponsored"" writing. The Collectory research methodology integrates I-Search writing (Macrorie, 1988), multigenre writing (Romano, 2000), collage/montage representation (Weathers, 1980, in Romano, 1995), and scholarly personal narrative (Nash, 2004), and also nurtures skills of innovation identified in a large-scale six-year study of creative executives (Fryer, 2009).|The Collectory is adaptable for use in multiple disciplines. In addition, satisfaction with the methodology is high; self-evaluation data collected over the past thirteen years from pre- and in-service teachers shows that eighty-nine percent of them believe these processes helped them engage more deeply in learning, providing skills they will practice themselves and use with their students. Wilkins-O'Riley Zinn began developing this approach as lead teacher in a high school dropout prevention program, drawing on previous media experience where creativity on demand and applied research were daily expectations. She continued developing it in university seminar where she taught the equivalent of Writing 121, 122, and 123, and continues her research in graduate education courses including human development, creativity, and educational research, building on insights gained while writing an autoethnographic dissertation exploring teacher/learner creativity (Zinn, 2004).|Because Collectory processes require ongoing sharing and evaluation of information, they are active and participatory, and also encourage the development of intellectual community. Assessment of personal learning and information sources is transparent and reflective, making cheating nearly impossible. In an increasingly diverse and interconnected world, research must be presented as accessible and infinitely interesting, and must be nurtured as a creative skill of lifelong learning.","","","","chen, juan/E-8441-2014","","","","Torres, IC|Chova, LG|Martinez, AL","","4th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation|(ICERI)","NOV 14-16, 2011","Madrid, SPAIN","","978-84-615-3324-4","","","","","","","","1"

OTP-DEF provides authentication by using OTP-based tests, which is different from other systems that use graphical tests. First of all, according to the load of web server, an OTP-DEF web server should fall into one of three following modes: normal, suspected attack or confirmed attack mode, and the OTP-DEF authentication mechanism shall only be activated when web server is in suspected attack mode. Secondly, we use OTP as our puzzle, which can automatically change at the certain time interval. It makes our proposal can defend socially-engineered attack, copy attacks, replay attacks and Brute-Force Attack. Thirdly, OTP-DEF uses an intermediate stage to identify the IP addresses that ignore the test, and persistently bombard the server with requests despite repeated failures at solving the puzzles.

In the classification scheme presented here, we divide the genome into ""functional DNA,"" that is, DNA sequences that have a selected-effect function, and ""rubbish DNA,"" that is, sequences that do not. Functional DNA is further subdivided into ""literal DNA"" and ""indifferent DNA."" In literal DNA, the order of nucleotides is under selection; in indifferent DNA, only the presence or absence of the sequence is under selection. Rubbish DNA is further subdivided into ""junk DNA"" and ""garbage DNA."" Junk DNA neither contributes to nor detracts from the fitness of the organism and, hence, evolves under selective neutrality. Garbage DNA, on the other hand, decreases the fitness of its carriers. Garbage DNA exists in the genome only because natural selection is neither omnipotent nor instantaneous. Each of these four functional categories can be 1) transcribed and translated, 2) transcribed but not translated, or 3) not transcribed. The affiliation of a DNA segment to a particular functional category may change during evolution: Functional DNA may become junk DNA, junk DNA may become garbage DNA, rubbish DNA may become functional DNA, and so on; however, determining the functionality or nonfunctionality of a genomic sequence must be based on its present status rather than on its potential to change (or not to change) in the future. Changes in functional affiliation are divided into pseudogenes, Lazarus DNA, zombie DNA, and Jekyll-to-Hyde DNA.","","25635041","10.1093/gbe/evv021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

And they have led, in many places, to violent reactions against people accused of illicit accumulation. In the struggles that have ensued, the major lines of opposition have been not race or class but generation-mediated by gender. Why is all this occurring with such intensity, right now An answer to the question, and to the more genera I problem of making sense of the enchantments of modernity, is sought in the encounter of rural South Africa with the contradictory effects of millennial capitalism and the culture of neoliberalism. This encounter, goes the argument, brings ""the global"" and ""the local""-treated here as analytic constructs rather than explanatory terms or empirical realities-into a dialectical interplay. It also has implications for the practice of anthropology, challenging us to do ethnography on an ""awkward"" scale, on planes that transect the here and now, then and there.","","","10.1525/ae.1999.26.2.279","French, Shaun/B-1155-2010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

This paper identifies zombie firms in Japan, and compares the characteristics of zombies to other firms. Zombie firms are found to be less profitable, more indebted, more dependent on their main banks, more likely to be found in non-manufacturing industries and more often located outside large metropolitan areas. Overall, larger size makes the firm less likely to be a zombie, but among small firms, relatively larger firms are more likely to be protected and become zombies. Controlling for profitability, the exit probability for zombie firms does not differ from that for non-zombies. Zombie firms tend to increase employment by more (but do not reduce employment by more) than non-zombies. Finally, when the proportion of zombie firms in an industry increases, job creation declines and job destruction increases, and the effects are stronger for non-zombies.","","","10.1111/j.1468-5876.2006.00354.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In this article I consider the ways in which whiteness may be best understood as a prosthetic that can situationally be attached/detached from white bodies. Paradoxically, this flexibility of whiteness increases white people's powers of symbolic and material control over environments and the bodies of people of colour. In earlier work I have considered prosthetic whiteness to be mostly associated with ruling class masculinities. However, in certain contexts this ruling class discourse may become generalized. To examine how situationally this might be the case I examine survivalist and preparedness literature ('disaster education') that considers the racialized other to be embodied, mindless, bodies ('zombies') and surviving whites to be disembodied, primal, heroic agents. Using popular culture, public information films and the recent preparedness information in the UK on 'swine flu' I show how people of colour are positioned as non-agentic, static and (most significantly) as immobile and risky bodies as opposed to the portrayal of 'white' subjects in preparedness as mobile and able subjects whose genetic survival is at stake.","","","10.1177/1468796810372299","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

These schemes can tackle virtually all kinds of DDoS attacks, even never-before-seen attack types, due to the underlying statistics-based adaptive differentiation. The viability of those aforementioned statistical filtering defense systems is based on the premise that attackers do not know the victim's nominal traffic profile and, thus, cannot fake legitimate traffic. However, a sophisticated DDoS attacker might circumvent the defense system by discovering the statistical filtering rules and then controlling zombies to generate flooding traffic according to these discovered rules. This type of sophisticated attack seriously threatens the current Internet and has not yet been solved.|In this paper, we propose a Principal Components Analysis (PCA)-based DDoS defense system, which extracts nominal traffic characteristics by analyzing intrinsic dependency across multiple attribute values. The PCA-based scheme differentiates attacking packets from legitimate ones by checking if the current traffic volume of the associated attribute value violates the intrinsic dependency of nominal traffic. The correlation among different attributes makes it more difficult for the attacker to accurately discover the statistic filtering rules and, thus, makes it highly robust to cope with new and more sophisticated attacks.","","","10.1109/ICC.2008.321","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Communications","IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2008)","MAY 19-23, 2008","Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA","IEEE, Chinese Inst Elect, Chinese Inst Commun, Tsinghu Univ, Beijing Univ, Posts & Telecommun","978-1-4244-2074-2","","IEEE","","","","","","3"

Due to the incalculability of many modern threats, enactment is employed as a method for rendering potential future events available as empirical phenomena. However, sometimes these potential futures are represented in ways that correspond only to imagined and fictional worlds. The aim of this article is to explore the enactment of unreal possibilities in contemporary preparedness exercises.

Two statistical measures namely Volume and Flow are used as parameters to detect DDoS attacks. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation testbed. Different attack scenarios are implemented by varying total number of zombie machines and at different attack strengths to measure effectiveness of proposed approach. Our simulation results show that FVBA inflicts an extremely high detection rate with low false alarm rate.","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Networks Proceedings","16th IEEE International Conference on Networks","DEC 12-14, 2008","New Delhi, INDIA","India Habitat Ctr, Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Elect & Comp Engn","978-1-4244-3805-1","","IEEE","","","","","","3"

The second section discusses two most influential antireductionist arguments - the knowledge argument and the argument from the conceivability of zombies. The the paper focuses on the epistemological and semantic aspects of the controversy that can be translated into the different interpretations of two-dimensional modal matrix, which allows to specify the disagreement between reductionism and antireductionism. Finally the conclusion arrived at in the last section is that the premises of antireductionist arguments are not compatible with the stable connection between mental and physiological domains, and thus contemporary philosophy of mind brings out the dilemma: either we hypostatize the introspectively available qualitative content on the basis of epistemic asymmetry of the mental and physical concepts, thereby deriving a dualist ontology, and embrace all the sceptical consequences, or we prefer the extensional explanation of concepts, without internalist ambitions, conceivability of zombies, and antireductionist conclusions.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","S","","","","","1"

From this observation, we developed a neural network detector trained by our DDoS prediction algorithm. Our preliminary experiments and analysis indicate that our proposed chaotic model can accurately and effectively detect DDoS attack traffic.

These zombie machines are said to be infected with a `bot' - a malicious piece of software which is installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the `botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single hot on a compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding behaviour.

Solid evidence for intergenerational cultures of worklessness is elusive so this study tested the idea via interviews with twenty families in Glasgow and Middlesbrough that had been long-term workless.

I argue here that the AD stigma is of a specific sort - it is dehumanisation based on disgust and terror. Although the blame for negative perceptions of people with AD has been placed on the biomedical understanding of dementia, I argue that strong negative emotional responses to AD are also buttressed by the social construction of people with AD as zombies. To illustrate this point, this paper identifies seven specific ways that the zombie metaphor is referenced in both the scholarly and popular literature on AD. This common referencing of zombies is significant as it infuses the social discourse about AD with a politics of revulsion and fear that separates and marginalises those with AD. It is in recognising the power of this zombie trope that its negative impact can be actively resisted through an emphasis of connectedness, commonality, and inter-dependency.","","","10.1017/S0144686X10000693","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","1"

We present simulations with a pseudo-spectral anelastic code and with the compressible code Athena, showing that stably stratified flows in a shearing, rotating box are violently unstable and produce space-filling, sustained turbulence dominated by large vortices with Rossby numbers of order similar to 0.2-0.3. This Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) is observed in both codes and is triggered by Kolmogorov turbulence with Mach numbers less than similar to 0.01. It is a common view that if a given constant density flow is stable, then stable vertical stratification should make the flow even more stable. Yet, we show that sufficient vertical stratification can be unstable to ZVI. ZVI is robust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions, or initial radial entropy or vortensity gradients (though we have studied ZVI only in the limit of infinite cooling time). The resolution of this paradox is that stable stratification allows for a new avenue to instability: baroclinic critical layers. ZVI has not been seen in previous studies of flows in rotating, shearing boxes because those calculations frequently lacked vertical density stratification and/ or sufficient numerical resolution. Although we do not expect appreciable angular momentum transport from ZVI in the small domains in this study, we hypothesize that ZVI in larger domains with compressible equations may lead to angular transport via spiral density waves.","1538-4357","","10.1088/0004-637X/808/1/87","Hassanzadeh, Pedram/A-7489-2008; ","Hassanzadeh, Pedram/0000-0001-9425-8085; Barranco,|Joseph/0000-0003-2045-677X","","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6"

With this semantics as a point of reference, we study several implementation strategies. We model STM systems that use in-place update, optimistic concurrency, lazy conflict detection, and rollback.

One important source of errors is that some efficient implementations create dangerous ""zombie"" computations where a transaction keeps running after experiencing a conflict; the assumptions confine the effects of these computations.","","","10.1145/1889997.1889999","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

In evaluating the psychosocial functioning of adolescents with cancer, research suggests that an altered self-image may emerge in those who have difficulty adjusting. However, little is known about adolescents' perceptions of how cancer affects their sense of self. Part of a larger study, this article addresses findings specific to understanding the impact that cancer and its symptoms had on adolescents' sense of self. To help discover meaningful interpretations of their experiences, a longitudinal, qualitative study was conducted. Data collection methods included open-ended, individual and focus group interviews and participant observation. The constant comparative method of data analysis yielded theoretical categories that were supported by the adolescents' narratives. Findings revealed that adolescents experienced changes in their lived bodies because of the symptoms and this, in turn, impacted their sense of self and way of being in the world. Six ways of being in the world were identified: life as a klutz; life as a prisoner; life as an invalid; life as an alien; life as a zombie; and life as a kid. In helping adolescents deal with the changes, it was important to family and friends to respond to them like they were the same person, but also to treat them special at times. Although adolescents spoke to the significance that cancer had on their lives, they described themselves as ""still being pretty muck the same person.""","","15681977","10.1097/00002820-200501000-00002","Guha, Sunni/E-8453-2011; Woodgate, Roberta/B-9038-2014; ","Woodgate, Roberta/0000-0002-7176-2390","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The zombie's evisceration of speech is then related to other modes of social and cultural performance. By analysing concert footage of Elvis Presley, a news report by Serene Branson and performances by Reggie Watts and Sue Tompkins, it is eventually proposed that Thingness might be extracted from the morbid conceit of zombie fiction, and rewritten instead as the symptom of a critically engaged practice.","2040-0616","","10.1080/14682761.2014.970340","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Science, 316, 1609-01612 2007), and improve learning and memory (Markowska et al. The Journal of Neuroscience, 15, 2063-2073 1995). Numerical studies have shown that coherent spiking can give rise to windows in time during which information transfer can be enhanced in neuronal networks (Abeles Israel Journal of Medical Sciences, 18, 83-92 1982; Lisman and Idiart Science, 267, 1512-1515 1995, Salinas and Sejnowski Nature Reviews. Neuroscience, 2, 539-550 2001). Unanswered questions are: 1) What is the transfer mechanism? And 2) how well can a transfer be executed? Here, we present a pulse-based mechanism by which a graded current amplitude may be exactly propagated from one neuronal population to another. The mechanism relies on the downstream gating of mean synaptic current amplitude from one population of neurons to another via a pulse. Because transfer is pulse-based, information may be dynamically routed through a neural circuit with fixed connectivity. We demonstrate the transfer mechanism in a realistic network of spiking neurons and show that it is robust to noise in the form of pulse timing inaccuracies, random synaptic strengths and finite size effects. We also show that the mechanism is structurally robust in that it may be implemented using biologically realistic pulses. The transfer mechanism may be used as a building block for fast, complex information processing in neural circuits. We show that the mechanism naturally leads to a framework wherein neural information coding and processing can be considered as a product of linear maps under the active control of a pulse generator. Distinct control and processing components combine to form the basis for the binding, propagation, and processing of dynamically routed information within neural pathways. Using our framework, we construct example neural circuits to 1) maintain a short-term memory, 2) compute time-windowed Fourier transforms, and 3) perform spatial rotations. We postulate that such circuits, with automatic and stereotyped control and processing of information, are the neural correlates of Crick and Koch's zombie modes.","1573-6873","26227067","10.1007/s10827-015-0570-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

However, few studies describe mechanisms underlying host coercion. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism by which an insect-transmitted pathogen of plants alters floral development to convert flowers into vegetative tissues. We find that phytoplasma produce a novel effector protein (SAP54) that interacts with members of the MADS-domain transcription factor (MTF) family, including key regulators SEPALLATA3 and APETALA1, that occupy central positions in the regulation of floral development. SAP54 mediates degradation of MTFs by interacting with proteins of the RADIATION SENSITIVE23 (RAD23) family, eukaryotic proteins that shuttle substrates to the proteasome. Arabidopsis rad23 mutants do not show conversion of flowers into leaf-like tissues in the presence of SAP54 and during phytoplasma infection, emphasizing the importance of RAD23 to the activity of SAP54. Remarkably, plants with SAP54-induced leaf-like flowers are more attractive for colonization by phytoplasma leafhopper vectors and this colonization preference is dependent on RAD23. An effector that targets and suppresses flowering while simultaneously promoting insect herbivore colonization is unprecedented. Moreover, RAD23 proteins have, to our knowledge, no known roles in flower development, nor plant defence mechanisms against insects. Thus SAP54 generates a short circuit between two key pathways of the host to alter development, resulting in sterile plants, and promotes attractiveness of these plants to leafhopper vectors helping the obligate phytoplasmas reproduce and propagate (zombie plants).|Author Summary Parasites that colonize multiple hosts often coerce these hosts into improving their own survival and reproduction rates. However, how parasites do this is largely unknown. Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant parasites that require sap-feeding insect vectorsleafhoppersfor their propagation and dispersal. It has been known for a long time that phytoplasmas stimulate dramatic developmental changes in a broad range of plant species, such as the conversion of flowers into leaves known as phyllody and the proliferation of stems known as witches' broom. Here we report how and why phytoplasmas cause these dramatic developmental changes. We identified a phytoplasma virulence protein, SAP54, which transforms flowers into leaves and converts plants into more attractive hosts for the egg-laying and reproduction of their leafhopper vectors. We show that SAP54 exerts its effect by promoting the degradation of proteins that regulate important developmental processes in flowering plants. These proteins are highly conserved transcription factors of the MADS-box family, and reducing their activity through SAP54-mediated degradation curtails flower development, generating sterile plants. This degradation process requires RAD23, a protein that recruits the transcription factors to the protein degradation machinery. The resulting sterile plants, which form leaves in place of flowers, are more attractive to leafhoppers, arguably making phytoplasmas master manipulators of the parasite world.","","24714165","10.1371/journal.pbio.1001835","","Orlovskis, Zigmunds/0000-0001-8583-9814","","e1001835","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7"

It situates these uses in relation to the current resurgence of zombies in popular fiction and film, and distinguishes zombies from vampires: while the former signifies global debt and stagnation, the latter connotes credit and consumer boom. It argues that the arc of desire and fear engendered by these figures of horror discloses a continuity in the affective trajectory of neo-liberalism as it supplants traditional philosophical distinctions between material and symbolic forms of debt. Rather than operating with a distinction between spiritual and financial modes of guilt/debt, an economic absorption of cultural values circumvents the need for subjective or symbolic inscriptions, and institutes the debt-relation directly and materially.","","","","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

However, epidemiological evidence shows that class-based inequalities have either persisted or widened, despite overall improvements in the health of Western populations. This article presents an exploratory qualitative study of the individualisation of class identity and health conducted in a southern English city. Findings are presented in consideration of two competing argumentative positions around which participants worked to negotiate class identity and health. The first of these positions denied the significance of class for identity and health and was associated with the individualised heroic and stoic narratives of working class identity. The second position acknowledged the reality of class relations and their implications for health and identity, being associated with structurally and politically orientated narratives of middle class identity. In sum, resistance to class was associated with talk about individual, private experience whereas the acceptance of class was linked to discussion of health as a wider social or political phenomenon. This evidence lends qualified support to the individualisation thesis: inequalities in health existing on structural or material levels are not simply reproduced, and indeed in some contexts may even juxtapose, accounts of social identity in interview and focus group contexts. Class identity and health are negotiated in lay talk as participants shift argumentatively back and forth between competing positions, and public and private realms, in the attempt to make sense of health and illness. The promotion of greater awareness and interest in health inequalities within wider public discourse may well help support attempts to tackle these injustices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Their longevity was based on two things: the relatively low cost of delivering very high accuracy to users, and the technical limitation that the range of high precision gauging systems was very small. While the first reason is still true, the second factor is being displaced by changes in measurement technology since the 1980s. New long range sensors do not require master gauges that are nearly the same length as the part being inspected, and thus one of the primary attributes of gauge blocks, wringing stacks to match the part, is 110 longer needed. Relaxing the requirement that gauges wring presents an opportunity to develop new types of end standards that would increase the accuracy and usefulness of gauging systems.","","","10.6028/jres.113.013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

From the resulting colony relatedness pattern we predicted strong worker-queen conflict over male production where both the workers and the queen attempt to produce the colony's males. To test for this conflict, male production was studied in 15 hornet nests using a combination of DNA microsatellite analysis (282 males), worker ovary dissections (500 workers from eight nests) and 50 h of observation (four nests). In contrast to our prediction, the data show that hornet males are queens' sons, that workers never attempt to lay eggs, rarely have activated ovaries, and that there is no direct aggression between the queen and the workers. This contrasts with other data for vespine wasps, which support relatedness predictions. Dolichovespula arenaria has the same kin structure as V. crabro and workers produce males in many colonies. The similarity between these two species makes it difficult to explain why workers do not reproduce in V. crabro. Self-restraint is expected if worker reproduction significantly reduces colony productivity but there is no obvious reason why this should be important to V. crabro but not to D. arenaria. Alternatively, queen control may be important. The absence of expressed queen-worker conflict rules out physical control. Indirect pheromonal control is a possibility and is supported by the occurrence of royal courts and queen pheromone in Vespa but not Dolichovespula. Pheromonal queen control is considered evolutionarily unstable, but could result from a queen-worker arms race over reproductive control in which the queen is ahead. The genetic data also revealed diploid males in one colony, the first example in the vespine wasps, and two colonies with double matrilines, suggesting that occasional usurpation by spring queens occurs.","","10849289","10.1046/j.1365-294x.2000.00920.x","","Foster, Kevin/0000-0003-4687-6633","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test whether Exergame smartphone applications increase physical activity levels. Methods: This was a 12-week randomized, controlled, parallel group trial. The intervention consisted of the use of Exergame smartphone apps and motivational messaging. Validated instruments were used to measure physical activity, enjoyment, motivation, and competence. Results: Forty subjects were randomized and completed baseline assessments; 39 (97.5%) completed the 12-week follow-up. Median age was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR]=25, 41.75); 85% were women. No differences between groups were identified in primary or secondary outcomes. Within group, physical activity decreased in the controls and autonomous motivation increased in the intervention group. Discussion: Exploratory findings were interesting regarding the use of Exergames to encourage physical activity. The intervention group showed less of a decline in activity, suggesting a possible attenuation of the observed seasonal fluctuation by the use of the Exergames. Translation to Health Education Practice Given their popularity, health educators should continue to explore the use of Exergame apps as a tool to facilitate physical activity.","2168-3751","","10.1080/19325037.2015.1043063","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

The three characters at issue are the ""jester"", the ""zombie"" and the ""simpleton"", each shining a light on a different set of challenges in today's Western societies. The jester, more particularly the Ubuesque one, represents the chasm between power and the indignity of those wielding it, echoing European worries about the fragility of democracy. As the walking dead who gave his insubstantial, fake and subjective life to the lure of consumer goods, the zombie evokes consumerism. Lastly, the simpleton's improbable ingenuousness and his inherent inability to adapt to his surroundings restrict to a minimum his interaction with figures of power, thereby making him the only ""madman"" in contemporary theater to have retained an ability to express a life force.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

This narrative of unconsciously repeated motifs that migrate from film to film is in turn analyzed as a recurrent symptom that haunts a number of Singaporean cinematic productions from the 1990s onwards. This symptom, which can be summarily described as a paranoid relationship to 'otherness', makes manifest a variety of psychic tendencies such as morbid fear of impotence, misogyny, and fetishization of the social other. For Ho, such impulses are in turn intricately linked to what he, following the literary critic Harold Bloom, calls 'The Anxiety of Influence'. For Bloom, every poet embarks upon his career after a prior encounter with another poet, or poem. As a result, the 'late-coming' poet inevitably suffers from a sense of threatened autonomy, because his profoundest insights and deepest desires are always already elucidated by another. For the Singaporean filmmaker, Ho argues that this 'anxiety' in relation to the cinematic tradition takes on a peculiar nature and a doubled pressure, for the canon that inspires them is perceived as being something essentially foreign. Hence the Singaporean filmmaker makes cinema as though he is stuttering in a foreign tongue. Therefore, the concept of 'the anxiety of influence' is modulated and compounded with a 'postcolonial anxiety'. In addition, Ho also draws upon the concepts of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze in an attempt to sketch out an ontology of cinema that at once functions in a deconstructive relationship to 'auteur-driven' modes of analyses, while avoiding what he perceives as the overly 'sociological' bent that characterizes much of the existing corpus of writings on Singaporean cinema.","","","10.1080/14649370701238839","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

According to them, TTD changes cultural conceptions of weddings and the visual position of married women. In these sessions, women wear white wedding dresses while strolling in unconventional surrounds, jumping into the water, smearing mud on themselves, and acting like zombies. This detailed study of the ways TTD is associated with resistance, with an emphasis on photographers' practices, contributes to resistance studies and feminist literature by considering how opposition is promised and marketed. For instance, photographers promote TTD images as creative, alternative, and better than wedding photography in promotional blogs and other forums. Claims that TTD politically transforms weddings and women's experiences are in need of critique. Resistance, pleasure, and prestige are intertwined in this cultural activity. It is not completely apt to relate this practice to photographers' utter control of images and brides or women's absolute refusal of traditional wedding cultures. TTD sessions are reliant on the norm producing aspects of Western weddings and photographers promote and manage the oppositional functions of TTD in order to maintain their creative position. Yet, women trouble feminine roles when staining gowns and appearing to slide beyond social control.","","","10.1080/15295036.2011.609826","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

We focus on three likely attack scenarios: ""wildfire"" worms that can spread contagiously over and across wireless LANs, coordinated citywide phishing campaigns based on wireless spoofing, and rogue systems for compromising location privacy in a coordinated fashion. The first attack illustrates how dense wifi deployment may provide opportunities for attackers who want to quickly compromise large numbers of machines. The last two attacks illustrate how botnets can amplify wifi vulnerabilities, and how botnet power is amplified by wireless connectivity.|To quantify these threats, we rely on real-world data extracted from wifi maps of large metropolitan areas in the States and Singapore. Our results suggest that a carefully crafted wireless worm can infect up to 80% of all wifi connected hosts in some metropolitan areas within 20 minutes, and that an attacker can launch phishing attacks or build a tracking system to monitor the location of 10-50% of wireless users in these metropolitan areas with just 1, 000 zombies under his control.","","","","","","","","","","16th USENIX Security Symposium","AUG 06-10, 2007","Boston, MA","","978-1-931971-54-6","","USENIX","","","","","","5"

The idea is that zombies are conceivable; beings that look like us and behave like us in all ways, but for which ""all is dark inside;"" that is, for a zombie, there is no ""what it is like."" There is no ""what it is like"" to be a zombie, there is no ""what it is like"" for a zombie to feel pain, there is no ""what it is like"" for a zombie to taste, or feel, or smell something. They are creatures without consciousness. I am skeptical about the conceivability of zombies. That is not to say that I believe that there is some inherent contradiction to be found in the idea of zombies. Instead, I do not think that I am justified in believing that zombies are conceivable. The focus on justification is not common in the literature on conceivability, or for that matter in the literature on the possibility of zombies. Instead, the focus tends to be on trying to find out whether or not the notion of a zombie is contradictory. It is widely accepted in the literature on conceivability that the absence of a contradiction when conceiving of X is both necessary and sufficient for X to be conceivable. That might be true of ideal conceivability, but as I will argue below, ideal conceivability is not relevant to our (human) pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Further, as I will argue, once we focus on non-ideal conceivability the notion of justification, and degrees of justification comes into play.","1572-8420","","10.1007/s10670-013-9486-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The characterization is carried out using several novel techniques to identify clients, local DNS servers, and authoritative DNS servers. Our techniques include passive and active measurements, graph-based analysis, examination of outliers, and explicit checks against data obtained from several external sources. Our contribution is the reduction of a very large data set (over 1 Terabyte of raw data) into a significantly smaller representation that is ideally suited for answering protocol-specific semantic queries quickly. After categorizing the addresses, we use the network aware clustering technique to group local DNS servers. By juxtaposing the DNS server clusters with clusters formed by Web clients obtained from a large portal Web site, we determine the distribution of identified DNS servers in busy clusters. A variety of applications are examined ranging from identifying suspected zombies to helping Content Distribution Networks in mapping location of DNS servers.","","","","","Cranor, Charles/0000-0003-2427-9627","","","","","1st ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Workshop (IMW 2001)","NOV 01-02, 2001","SAN FRANCISCO, CA","ACM Press, Net Veloc Made Good, Sprint","1-58113-435-5","","ACM|ACM|ACM","","","","","","4"

More than 200,000 new malicious codes appear, with more than 30,000 malicious codes distributed each day on average. These cyber attacks are expanding gradually to the social infrastructure (nuclear energy, power, water, etc.) and smart sensor networks. This paper proposes a method of detecting malware propagation in sensor Node and botnet clustering automatically by analyzing e-mails. More than 80% of spam e-mails are generated by the Node infected with malicious code, using various methods to avoid filtering such as direct-to-MX, fake Received header, and open relay vulnerability. This paper proposes a scheme that detects those types accurately, including a clustering method that targets the URL included in the e-mail body, e-mail subject, attached file, and hosting server, to detect the botnet group infected with the same malicious code. The proposed method recorded about 85% zombie IP detection rate when spam e-mails distributed in a commercial environment were analyzed. When applied to the portal site that delivers 10 million e-mails, the proposed technology is expected to detect at least 150,000 zombie Nodes each day. If advanced measures are taken against the detected zombie Nodes, the spread of cyber attack damages can apparently be reduced.","1550-1477","","10.1155/2015/530250","","","","530250","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

The argument presented here is that sexual performatives relating to marriage-and especially, in this instance, consummation-continue to produce a kind of social-legal magic, even as the social flesh of their enactment is rotting. Rules concerning annulment relating to wedding ceremonies, consent, disclosure, and consummation demonstrate that certain frameworks of conjugality involve a kind of corporeal magic animating the privileged place of heterosexual marriage. Thus, rules and regulations pertaining to weddings continue to produce and protect heterogendered, sexually dimorphous bodies, even though this privileging is-or at least, is becoming-socially obsolete.","1572-8455","","10.1007/s10691-013-9246-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Grid-generated turbulence (Re-lambda less than or equal to 25) in a stable linear mean background density gradient was passed through a two-dimensional contraction, contracting the stream only in the vertical direction. This induces an increase in stratification strength, which reduces the largest vertical overturning scales allowed by buoyancy forces. The mean strain through the contraction causes, on the other hand, stretching of streamwise vortices tending to increase the fluctuation levels of the transverse velocity components. This competition between buoyancy and vortex stretching dominates the turbulence dynamics inside and downstream of the contraction. Comparison between non-stratified and stratified experiments shows that the stratification significantly reduces the vertical velocity fluctuations. The vertical heat flux is initially enhanced through the contraction. Then, farther downstream the flux quickly reverses, leading to very strong restratification coinciding with an increase in the vertical velocity fluctuations. The vertical heat flux collapses much more rapidly than in the stratified case without an upstream contraction and the restratification intensity is also much stronger, showing values of normalized flux as strong as -0.55. Velocity spectra show that the revival of vertical velocity fluctuations, due to the strong restratification, starts at the very largest scales but is then subsequently transferred to smaller scales. The distance from the turbulence-generating grid to the entrance of the contraction is an important parameter which was varied in the experiments. The larger this distance, the larger the integral length scale can grow, approaching the limit set by buoyancy, before entering the contraction. The evolution of the various turbulence length scales is described. Two-point measurements of velocity and temperature transverse integral scales were also performed inside the contraction. The emergence of 'zombie' turbulence, for large buoyancy times, is in good quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations of Gerz & Yamazaki (1993) for stratification number larger than 1.","","","10.1017/S0022112095000589","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Intuitively, they seem conceivable, and many take this to support their metaphysical possibility - a result that, most agree, would refute physicalism. John Hawthorne (2002) [Philosophical Studies 109, 17-52] and David Braddon-Mitchell (2003) [The Journal of Philosophy 100, 111-135] have developed a novel response to this argument: phenomenal concepts have a conditional structure - they refer to non-physical states if such states exist and otherwise to physical states - and this explains the zombie intuition. I argue that this strategy fails. The considerations Hawthorne and Braddon-Mitchell adduce in support of their analysis in fact do no such thing. Further, their main argument for the analysis is self-defeating: exactly similar reasoning would undermine the view it is meant to establish. Finally, on closer inspection the conditional analysis is incompatible with the zombie intuition. Thus, not only is the analysis incapable of explaining the intuition: the intuition's plausibility indicates that the analysis is incorrect. I also suggest that the allure of the conditional-analysis strategy may derive from a questionable view about what explaining the intuition would require.","","","10.1007/s11098-005-1485-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

To this end, the adult wasp stings a cockroach and injects venom directly inside its brain, turning the prey into a submissive 'zombie'. Here, we characterize the sensory arsenal on the wasp's stinger that enables the wasp to identify the brain target inside the cockroach's head. An electron microscopy study of the stinger reveals (a) cuticular depressions innervated by a single mechanosensory neuron, which are presumably campaniform sensilla; and (b) dome-shaped structures innervated by a single mechanosensory neuron and 4-5 chemosensory neurons, which are presumably contact-chemoreceptive sensilla. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings from stinger afferents show increased firing rate in response to mechanical stimulation with agarose. This response is direction-selective and depends upon the concentration (density) of the agarose, such that the most robust response is evoked when the stinger is stimulated in the distal-to-proximal direction (concomitant with the penetration during the natural stinging behavior) and penetrating into relatively hard (0.75%-2.5%) agarose pellets. Accordingly, wasps demonstrate a normal stinging behavior when presented with cockroaches in which the brain was replaced with a hard (2.5%) agarose pellet. Conversely, wasps demonstrate a prolonged stinging behavior when the cockroach brain was either removed or replaced by a soft (0.5%) agarose pellet, or when stinger sensory organs were ablated prior to stinging. We conclude that the parasitoid jewel wasp uses at least mechanosensory inputs from its stinger to identify the brain within the head capsule of the cockroach prey.","","24586962","10.1371/journal.pone.0089683","","","","e89683","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.","","","10.1080/10508406.2010.508029","Ainsworth, Shaaron/C-1922-2009","Ainsworth, Shaaron/0000-0002-9453-7196","","PII 932276454","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

He asserts that these concepts show that the facts about consciousness, such as experience or qualia, are really further facts about our world, over and above the physical facts. He claims that they are the hard part of the mind-body issue. He also claims that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the world like mass, charge, etc.|He says that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical and all current attempts to assert an identity between consciousness and the physical are just as non-reductive as his dualism. They are simply correlations and are part of the problem of the explanatory gap. In this paper, three examples of strong identities between a sensation or a quale and a physiological process are presented, which overcome these problems. They explain the identity in an a priori manner and they show that consciousness or sensations (Q) logically supervene on the physical (P), in that it is logically impossible to have P and not to have Q. In each case, the sensation was predicted and entailed by the physical. The inverted spectrum problem for consciousness is overcome and explained by a striking asymmetry in colour space. It is concluded that as some physical properties realize some sensations or qualia that human zombies are not metaphysically possible and the explanatory gap is bridged in these cases. Thus, the hard problem is overcome in these instances.","","","10.1007/s11229-004-8006-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Through an analysis of Japan's mixed-member electoral system, we demonstrate that legislative organization is strongly influenced not only by the individual legislators reelection incentives but also by their interest in their party gaining power and maintaining a strong party label. Electorally vulnerable legislators are given choice legislative positions to enhance their prospects at the polls, whereas (potential) party leaders disproportionately receive posts with greater influence on the party's overall reputation. Members of Parliament elected from proportional representation (PR) lists and in single member districts also receive different types of posts, reflecting their distinct electoral incentives. Even small variations in electoral rules can have important consequences for legislative organization. In contrast to Germany's compensatory mixed-member system, Japan's parallel system (combined with a ""best loser"" or ""zombie"" provision) generates incentives for the party to allocate posts relating to the distribution of particularistic goods to those elected in PR.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

Though the spam filtering systems currently in use block IPs that send email spam, simply blocking the IPs of zombie PCs participating in a botnet is not enough to prevent the spamming activities of the botnet because these IPs can easily be changed or manipulated. This IP blocking is also insufficient to prevent crimes other than spamming, as the botnet can be simultaneously used for multiple purposes. For this reason, we propose a system that detects botnets and zombie PCs based on email spam analysis. This study introduces the concept of ""group pollution level"" - the degree to which a certain spam group is suspected of being a botnet - and ""IP pollution level"" - the degree to which a certain IP in the spam group is suspected of being a zombie PC. Such concepts are applied in our system that detects botnets and zombie PCs by grouping spam mails based on the URL links or attachments contained, and by assessing the pollution level of each group and each IP address. For empirical testing, we used email spam data collected in an ""email spam trap system"" Korea's national spam collection system. Our proposed system detected 203 botnets and 18,283 zombie PCs in a day and these zombie PCs sent about 70% of all the spam messages in our analysis. This shows the effectiveness of detecting zombie PCs by email spam analysis, and the possibility of a dramatic reduction in email spam by taking countermeasure against these botnets and zombie PCs.","","","10.3837/tiis.2012.05.011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

Apoptotic microtubule network (AMN) is organized during apoptosis forming a cortical structure beneath plasma membrane that maintains plasma membrane integrity. Apoptotic cells are also characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that can be potentially harmful for the cell. The aim of this study was to develop a method that allows stabilizing apoptotic cells for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. By using a cocktail composed of taxol (a microtubule stabilizer), Zn2+ (a caspase inhibitor) and coenzyme Q(10) (a lipid antioxidant), we were able to stabilize H460 apoptotic cells in cell cultures for at least 72 h, preventing secondary necrosis. Stabilized apoptotic cells maintain many apoptotic cell characteristics such as the presence of apoptotic microtubules, plasma membrane integrity, low intracellular calcium levels and mitochondrial polarization. Apoptotic cell stabilization may open new avenues in apoptosis detection and therapy.","","25118929","10.1038/cddis.2014.332","Sanchez-Alcazar, Jose A./L-4925-2014; Cordero, Mario D./L-8006-2014","Sanchez-Alcazar, Jose A./0000-0001-9705-1469; Cordero, Mario|D./0000-0003-0151-3644","","e1369","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1|4"

Bradley(5) reported the first use of psychostimulant medications in children in 1938. He administered benzedrine (10-20 mg/day) to 30 children aged 5 to 14 years who were hospitalized because of severe behavior disorders. His description 60 years ago of the medication's action in these children is still familiar today:|Probably the most striking change in behavior during the week of benzedrine therapy occurred in the school activities of many of these patients. Fourteen children responded in a spectacular fashion. Different teachers, reporting on these patients, who varied in age and school accomplishment, agreed that a great increase of interest in school material was noted immediately. There appeared a definite ""drive"" to accomplish as much as possible during the school period, and often to spend extra time completing additional work. Speed of comprehension and accuracy of performance were increased in most cases. Insight into school performance was generally present, though few of the children attributed it to the medication they had received earlier in the day. The improvement was noted in all school subjects. It appeared promptly the first day benzedrine was given and disappeared on the first day it was discontinued.(5)|Barkley(2) reviewed the early research on psychostimulant drugs in hyperactive children, which by 1977 included many open and double-blind studies and involved hundreds of subjects. Between 1938 and 1974, 15 studies involving 915 children were performed, examining the effectiveness of methylphenidate for the control of hyperactivity. Seventy-seven percent of the subjects were judged to be improved when on methylphenidate. Similar rates of improvement were found for children treated with amphetamines (14 studies, 860 children) and pemoline (2 studies, 105 children). In the eight double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of the three types of psychostimulants, the mean improvement of hyperactive children on the placebo was only 39%. The effect size of psychostimulants can be calculated from such studies to be at approximately 1.0, the largest effect size of any of the psychotropic medications. Despite the long-time use of psychostimulants in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), several questions remain:|Are all the psychostimulants interchangeable, or are some children selective responders to a particular psychostimulant? What data are available on Adderall, a mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine? Is it a useful addition to other agents for treating ADHD? What research has been done on other long-acting psychostimulants, such as the sustained-release (SR) methylphenidate (Ritalin-SR) or pemoline (Cylert)?|What is the best way to dose psychostimulants? Is there a danger of raising the dose ""too high"" such that improved behavior in fact leads to a decrease in academic productivity (the so-called ""zombie effect"")?|Is there any way to predict which children with ADHD are most likely torespond to psychostimulants?|What side effects are encountered with psychostimulants? In particular, what is the risk for hepatic failure with pemoline? Can children with ADHD with ties be treated safely with psychostimulants? What are the latest data regarding the effects of psychostimulants on growth?|The physician who manages children with ADI-ID must have a thorough understanding of all the issues involved in psychostimulant treatment.","","9884676","10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70063-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

If zombies are possible then physicalism (the thesis that the physical determines the mental) is false. It has been argued that zombies are possible if conceivable for an agent with ideal rationality. At any rate, they are possible only if so conceivable. This essay uses a mereological constraint to highlight the fine-grained differences between actually conscious physical objects and certain of their actually consciousness-incapable proper parts. These mereological considerations form the basis of an argument by dilemma that zombies are inconceivable. Either an arbitrary actually conscious object might have had simpler consciousness-capable parts (and more complex consciousness-incapable parts) than it in fact has, or not. The affirmative horn leads to a version of panpsychism that is inconsistent with the ideal conceivability of zombies. The negative horn rules out zombies as incoherent. The upshot is a new reason to deny the conceivability of zombies.","1460-2113","","10.1093/mind/fzu142","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the security of ADSL routers and identifY the potential of attacks, which attempt to compromise the vulnerabilities of their web interface. More specifically, we present common vulnerabilities and attacks that occur in websites on the Internet, and project them on the special characteristics of the web management interface of ADSL routers. To put this analysis into a practical context, we investigate the security of a popular ADSL router provided by a Greek iSP. in this security assessment, we have discovered two O-day vulnerabilities in the web management interface of the tested router. In particular, we discovered an operating system (OS) command injection and stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. A malicious may exploit these vulnerabilities to perform several large-scale attacks. Specifically, he/she can perform DNS hijacking attack and redirect the users to fake web sites for phishing; mount a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using the compromised routers as zombie machines; or even spread a malware. Finally, we discuss some well-known security practices that should be followed from developers and users to enhance the security of ADSL routers.","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information|Technology","IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information|Technology (ISSPIT)","DEC 12-15, 2013","Athens, GREECE","IEEE, Univ Piraeus, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Piraeus Res Ctr, Univ Patras","978-1-4799-4796-6","","IEEE","","","","","","3"

This paper reports the evaluation results of proposed approach that utilizes this extend of deviation from detection threshold, to estimate strength of DDoS attack using multiple regression model. A relationship is established between strength of DDoS attacks and observed deviation in sample entropy. Various statistical performance measures, such as Coefficient of determination (R2), Coefficient of Correlation (CC), Sum of Square Error (SSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Mean square Error (NMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (eta) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to measure the performance of the regression model. Internet type topologies used for simulation are generated using Transit-Stub model of GT-ITM topology generator. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation test bed for launching DDoS attacks with varied attack strengths. The simulation results are promising as we are able to estimate strength of DDoS attack efficiently with very less error rate using multiple regression model.","","","","","","","","Meghanathan, N|Kaushik, BK|Nagamalai, D","Communications in Computer and Information Science","1st International Conference on Computer Science and Information|Technology","JAN 02-04, 2011","Bangalore, INDIA","Acad & Ind Res Collaborat Ctr","978-3-642-17880-1","","","","III","","","","4"

Considered a convenient, powerful and a low cost tool, it is widely used to convey all kind of information including -unfortunately - sensitive or confidential information such as passwords, personal data, and private information. In recent times, two emerging technologies, referred to as the cloud computing and browser-based email technologies, have gained popularity among users and, along the way, also added a new significant layer of risk: It is common practice now from users to store their passwords into email folders and even worse, most of those browsers store and remember your password to open your email account automatically. Let's imagine the consequences of an attack launched by cybercriminals designed to resend and divert the original functionalities and features inherent to the browser for any malicious purpose, or worse - terrorist attempts. Let's take for example a US military officer operating in a country at war such as Afghanistan simply sending emails to his family to keep in touch with them. Whenever he sends an email, thousands of emails containing racial slurs against Muslim people are automatically sent to Afghan troops from his web account without him knowing it. The consequences of such an action would be unquestionably devastating. This above example, though fictitious, illustrates how efficient this kind of emails could be for both war propaganda and deception operations against US troops. Now imagine a company 's decision maker who daily exchanges large amounts of emails containing sensitive or confidential information within and outside his company ranging from trade secrets, contracts details, customer lists, research reports, financial information to staff's personal details. Modifying the browser-based email technology could enable any ill-intended person to wiretap and to eavesdrop any email directly at the browser's level to record any sent data and to make them evade from the computer towards unscrupulous people. The collection of the daily flow of emails, both internally and externally, definitely provides a snapshot of a company's overall culture and is proving to be a powerful and efficient tool used for both industrial and economic espionage. As a last example, these technologies once modified, could be used to set up thousand of zombies in mail clients. For that purpose, a large number of email clients would simultaneously send thousands of mails to a single target - e.g. an email server - to deny mail service for a limited period of time. We can easily imagine that this kind of attack launched on any stock exchange computer systems would entail damaging economic repercussions for the affected country and would probably plunge it into chaos for some time. In this paper, we will explain and show that email can be used as a ideal weapon for terrorism, cyber warfare, espionage, denial of service and can cripple all sectors of economy and nation states. We will address these issues both at the technical and operational level. In any case, we have considered systems with the most restricted user's privileges, but making those attacks really easy and powerful.","","","","","","","","Ottis, R","","10th European Conference on Information Warfare and Security (ECIW)","JUL 07-08, 2011","Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Cybernet (IoC), Tallinn, ESTONIA","","978-1-908272-06-5","Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Cybernet (IoC)","","","","","","","3"

It includes variables from HUD Aggregate USPS Administrative Data on Address Vacancies, the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 20052009, housing choice voucher (HCV) records of local public housing agencies, and municipal in rem property records. Multiple regression is used to identify significant relationships between vacancy patterns, socioeconomic characteristics, and institutional factors. The findings from this analysis suggest that the percent of vacant residential properties increases in census tracts with elevated poverty rates, higher percentages of renters receiving rental assistance, and long-term vacancies. They also suggest that the percent of abandoned residential properties increases in census tracts with highly concentrated black populations, elevated poverty rates, long-term vacancies, and higher percentages of business addresses. We conclude that these relationships are unique to older core cities experiencing systemic population and job losses. These cities struggle with a distinct type of long-term vacant and abandoned structures, which we label zombie properties. They can be contrasted with vacant and abandoned properties in transitional or regenerating areas. We offer recommendations for further analysis of zombie properties in these urban settings.","","","10.1111/j.1467-9906.2012.00627.x","","Silverman, Robert/0000-0003-2155-7871","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

Breeding goals have been broadened beyond production traits in most farm animal species to include health and functional traits, and opportunities exist to increase the inclusion of behaviour in breeding indices. On a technical level, breeding for behaviour presents a number of particular challenges compared to physical traits. It is much more difficult and time-consuming to directly measure behaviour in a consistent and reliable manner in order to evaluate the large numbers of animals necessary for a breeding programme. For this reason, the development and validation of proxy measures of key behavioural traits is often required. Despite these difficulties, behavioural traits have been introduced by certain breeders. For example, ease of handling is now included in some beef cattle breeding programmes. While breeding for behaviour is potentially beneficial, ethical concerns have been raised. Since animals are adapted to the environment rather than the other way around, there may be a loss of 'naturalness' and/or animal integrity. Some examples, such as breeding for good maternal behaviour, could enhance welfare, production and naturalness, although dilemmas emerge where improved welfare could result from breeding away from natural behaviour. Selection against certain behaviours may carry a risk of creating animals which are generally unreactive ('zombies'), although such broad effects could be measured and controlled. Finally, breeding against behavioural measures of welfare could inadvertently result in resilient animals ('stoics') that do not show behavioural signs of low welfare yet may still be suffering. To prevent this, other measures of the underlying problem should be used, although cases where this is not possible remain troubling.","","","","Olsson, I Anna/C-1792-2008; Sandoe, Peter/E-8758-2015; ","Sandoe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273; Olsson, Anna/0000-0002-4369-8723","","","","","","","","","","","","S","","","","","5"

This paper asks what contribution small farms in the uplands can make to societies' goals, what role they might play in the sustainability of rural communities in such regions, and how this contribution might be supported by state policies. In Scotland and in Norway these questions have recently been the subject of policy debates which appear to offer exceptions or alternatives to neoliberal universalism, and these are considered specifically in this paper. In each case support for small farms is seen as necessary to maintain 'lights in the windows' of remoter rural areas. Moreover, each highlights the vital role of the state in offering not only financial support but also in regulating land transfers and occupancy. It is argued that the dismantling of such regulatory powers depletes the state's ability to manage the tensions between continuity and change which are at the heart of sustainable rural development. The paper concludes that small farms can persist and can contribute to rural sustainability in ways that have been infrequently recognised under neoliberalism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking Pride and Prejudice as an example, the author points to the frequency of the filmic, TV and literary adaptations of this most famous of Austen's novels. The author focuses on the recent appropriation of the novel in Seth Grahame-Smith's bestseller Pride & Prejudice & Zombies (2009) which introduces minor textual interventions that transform the novel's plot into a story about a zombie invasion and the Bennet sisters' struggle against it as ninja-warriors. The author suggests that the success of Grahame-Smith's novel owes more to the popularity of the classic's film and TV adaptations and the easy recognition of ""Jane Austen"" as a brand, alongside its symbolic capital on the global cultural market, than to new readings of the adapted text. Moreover, the author draws the attention to the discrepancy between the historical evidence about Jane Austen's unconventional life and opinions and the ideologically conservative and today globally recognizable brand of ""Jane Austen"". The roots of the latter are located in the Victorian appropriation of Jane Austen's life and works, whose sentimental and censored view of Austen we inherit. The author concludes that the zombific(a)tion of Pride and Prejudice by Grahame-Smith presents the most vivid illustration of the contemporary trend of adopting and appropriating Jane Austen, where a whole literary and film niche depends, in turn, on the fame and prestige of the author and her books and on keeping the works and the author alive.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

When parasitized ants left the nest, they were highly mobile, were responsive to tactile stimuli, and showed minimal defensive behavior. Ants ultimately entered into a grass thatch layer, where they were decapitated and the fly maggots pupariated.

Some examples are layer-7 switches, content inspection and transformation systems, and network intrusion detection/prevention systems. Such systems must maintain per-flow state in order to correctly perform their higher-level processing. A basic operation inherent to per-flow state management for a transport protocol such as TCP is the task of reassembling any out-of-sequence packets delivered by an underlying unreliable network protocol such as IP. This seemingly prosaic task of reassembling the byte stream becomes an order of magnitude more difficult to soundly execute when conducted in the presence of an adversary whose goal is to either subvert the higher-level analysis or impede the operation of legitimate traffic sharing the same network path.|We present a design of a hardware-based high-speed TCP reassembly mechanism that is robust against attacks. It is intended to serve as a module used to construct a variety of network analysis systems, especially intrusion prevention systems. Using trace-driven analysis of out-of-sequence packets, we first characterize the dynamics of benign TCP traffic and show how we can leverage the results to design a reassembly mechanism that is efficient when dealing with non-attack traffic. We then refine the mechanism to keep the system effective in the presence of adversaries. We show that although the damage caused by an adversary cannot be completely eliminated, it is possible to mitigate the damage to a great extent by careful design and resource allocation. Finally, we quantify the trade-off between resource availability and damage from an adversary in terms of Zombie equations that specify, for a given configuration of our system, the number of compromised machines an attacker must have under their control in order to exceed a specified notion of ""acceptable collateral damage.""","","","","","","","","","","14th USENIX Security Symposium","JUL 31-AUG 05, 2005","Baltimore, MD","USENIX Assoc","1-931971-34-X","","USENIX Assoc","","","","","","2"

In comparison with IRC chat, the TCP conversations within IRC botnets show a nature of approximate periodicity defined as quasi-periodicity in this paper. A simple yet effective detection method is presented to detect IRC botnets by measuring the quasi-periodicity degree and packet average size of IRC conversations based on ukkonen algorithm.

To outline the background and nursing interventions for Solanum infection in the event of a zombie epidemic. Background. Literature and feature film evidence supports the theoretical probability for an outbreak of a Solanum infection which could result in a zombie epidemic. This paper discusses the causative agent, history of zombiism, signs and symptoms, diagnosis and nursing interventions. Design. Review. Methods. Academic and general literature and web sites were searched up to February 2011 for the key words, zombie, zombie nurses, zombie epidemic and zombie nursing interventions. Limited academic literature was sourced pointing to a serious knowledge deficit in this area. Results. If nurses are to respond successfully to a potential Solanum epidemic they need to be prepared and able to recognise Solanum infection, prevent its spread and care appropriately for sufferers and victims of a zombie attack. Advice is offered on prevention, initial nursing management and secondary nursing interventions including dealing with reanimation, palliative care and psychological support. Conclusion. History offers numerous examples of the sudden appearance of a serious disease that has impacted on man kinds survival. While difficult to conceive, a zombie epidemic is theoretically possible and nurses have a responsibility to be as prepared as possible to support and care for victims. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses are likely to be the front line staff faced with initiating most primary and secondary care interventions, including isolation and infection control, wound care, pain relief, documentation observations, support for activities of daily living, nutrition and fluid support, medication administration and other interventions.","","22211862","10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03920.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The problem is that he accepts this paradox as part of his theory. This philosophical move, however, is not acceptable, for the paradox undermines Chalmers' theory, by showing that the zombie argument is, actually, an argument against dualism. Chalmers tries to solve this problem with many arguments based on the status of consciousness as brute indubitable explanandum.

In analysing these films, the paper abandons the a priori expectation that the use of affect will produce a set of sane (non-paranoid), fostering and liberating possibilities. The general argument of the paper is instead that these films simultaneously induce interpretative paranoia and present the spectator with the possibility that the foundation for this paranoia is inherently unstable. Thus, the paper ultimately explores the usefulness of affect on material that appears to lend itself to the traditional deconstructive endeavour and discerns points of commonality between deconstruction and affect studies.","","","10.1080/10304312.2013.772103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

As the last speaker utters her/his last words, the 'expert' is there to record this important moment and preserve it for all time. Among the benefits from such preservation efforts is the ability to play back the recordings at any time in any place. In popular media this process is described as 'saving the language' through recording and documentation. Unfortunately, these recordings are not living voices. Rather, they are zombie voices-undead voices that are disembodied and techno-mechanized. They are cursed with being neither dead nor alive. They become artefacts of technological interventions, as well as expert valorisations of linguistic codes. Expert rhetoric compounds the problem by the use of metaphoric frames such as death, endangerment and extinction. Metaphors not only frame discourses of language endangerment, but they also frame and influence actions and interventions. This essay critically evaluates the metaphors used by language experts to understand the unintended consequences for community members who are actively revitalising and reclaiming their languages. The essay also identifies key strategies used by community language activists to ignore existing metaphors, while creating new metaphors to potentiate new solutions to language death to promote emergent vitalities.","1469-2902","","10.1080/00664677.2012.694170","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

It is poorly understood why rodents creating long-term reserves, especially those in the tropics, incorporate seeds from plant species that germinate rapidly and hence seem unsuitable for long-term storage. We carried out a series of experiments to understand why red acouchies (Myoprocta exilis) scatter-hoard Carapa procera (Meliaceae) seeds, which lack dormancy and germinate rapidly. Hypotheses tested were: (1) even germinated seeds are still significant long-term energy reserves for acouchies, (2) acouchies use the seeds only as short-term supplies, and (3) acouchies manipulate the seeds to slow down germination. The first two hypotheses were not supported; seed reserves were rapidly depleted during experimental planting, and acouchies did use seeds for long-term storage. We did find support for the third hypothesis. Acouchies intervened in germination by removing the protruding radicle and epicotyl after which they re-cached seeds. Pruning stopped further seedling development, yet the pruned seeds did not decay. The cotyledons apparently stayed alive and physiologically active as ""zombie seeds"" that only formed undifferentiated calli. Pruned seeds were suitable for long-term storage, with negligible loss of endosperm over time. Pruning was most effective after sprouting of the epicotyl, and germinating seeds were most susceptible to pruning during two weeks upon emergence. Acouchies actively managed their food supplies and must continuously survey for germinating seeds to timely intervene in seed reserve depletion, within the brief period of seedling emergence. We suggest that the trees use the rodents to achieve seed dispersal, and gain from imperfect intervention in germination by the rodents. Because scatter-hoarding rodents and large-seeded plant species with similar germination co-occur in tropical forests world-wide, it is plausible that the phenomenon of seed pruning to preserve seeds is more general than currently appreciated.","","","10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14461.x","Jansen, Patrick/G-2545-2015","Jansen, Patrick/0000-0002-4660-0314","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

This article arrives at a diagnosis different from Streeck's: if there has been a 'Hayekian' regime, it had already developed after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 and the subsequent dismantling of capital controls in the USA and Europe. As it appeared in the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the ultimate practical test of the Hayekian vision was dramatically negative. European crisis management, as it is still largely occupied with the imperative to maintain the solvency of troubled Euro states vis-a-vis the capital markets, is not following a Hayekian script. Rather, it is confronted with the challenge of removing the debris of the collapse of the former Hayekian regime, taking the form of zombie banks and large uncovered capital claims. Tomaster this challenge, not only intact European institutions and transnational cooperation in Europe would be required, but also much more democratic pressure from below.","1461-7137","","10.1177/1368431014530924","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Our goal is to propose a distributed architecture and introduce novel algorithms for malicious (potential hot-net) activity recognition based on network traffic statistics generated by Net Flow. Scalability and robustness were the main principles during the design of the architecture. In this paper, we demonstrate that we are able to reduce the number of Net Flow records significantly with an own aggregation scheme.

We observed that the zombies use controlled function(s) to pump attack packages to the victim, therefore, the attack flows to the victim are always share some properties, e.g. packages distribution behaviors, which are not possessed by legitimate flows in a short time period. Based on this observation, once there appear suspicious flows to a server, we start to calculate the distance of the package distribution behavior among the suspicious flows. If the distance is less than a given threshold, then it is a DDoS attack, otherwise, it is a legitimate accessing.

We show here that such neuro-chemical manipulation can be attributed to decreased neuronal activity in a small region of the cockroach cerebral nervous system, the sub-esophageal ganglion (SEG). A decrease in descending permissive inputs from this ganglion to thoracic central pattern generators decreases the propensity for walking-related behaviors.|Methodology and Principal Findings: We have used behavioral, neuro-pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to show that: (1) Surgically removing the cockroach SEG prior to wasp stinging prolongs the duration of the sting 5-fold, suggesting that the wasp actively targets the SEG during the stinging sequence; (2) injecting a sodium channel blocker, procaine, into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches reversibly decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, suggesting that the SEG plays an important role in the up-regulation of locomotion; (3) artificial focal injection of crude milked venom into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, as seen with naturally-stung cockroaches; and (4) spontaneous and evoked neuronal spiking activity in the SEG, recorded with an extracellular bipolar microelectrode, is markedly decreased in stung cockroaches versus non-stung controls.|Conclusions and Significance: We have identified the neuronal substrate responsible for the venom-induced manipulation of the cockroach's drive for walking. Our data strongly support previous findings suggesting a critical and permissive role for the SEG in the regulation of locomotion in insects. By injecting a venom cocktail directly into the SEG, the parasitoid Jewel Wasp selectively manipulates the cockroach's motivation to initiate walking without interfering with other non-related behaviors.","","20383324","10.1371/journal.pone.0010019","","","","e10019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

The difference lies in the fact that, whereas the entire fiction is a product of the authors when using transmedia, by crossmedia the audience also participates in the making, sometimes even taking the place of the original authors. Throughout this article, we will analyse Lost Zombies as a crossmedia project in which the audience is the author, and Panzer Chocolate, a transmedia project in which the authors offer several options through different formats for the entertainment of the users. But we will not only consider entertainment: these new forms of communication can also be very useful to education. In this sense, Crocodox is a project for an interactive documentary for elementary students, still in the making. In a nutshell, this article presents the new possibilities crossmedia and transmedia give way to in a future that has hardly been outlined.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Many of those strategies were also used in Japan to combat its banking problems in the 1990s. There are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current U.S. crisis and the recent Japanese crisis. The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in 2003. From these unsuccessful attempts, we derive eight lessons. In light of these eight lessons, we assess the policies the U.S. has pursued. The U.S. has ignored three of the lessons and it is too early to evaluate the U.S. policies with respect to four of the others. So far, the U.S. has avoided Japan's problem of having impaired banks prop up zombie firms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

They beg the question against physicalism in the sense that the argument will only seem compelling if one is already assuming that qualitative properties are nonphysical. To show this I will present the reverse-zombie and reverse-knowledge arguments. The only evidence against physicalism is a priori arguments, but there are also a priori arguments against dualism of exactly the same variety. Each of these parity arguments has premises that are just as intuitively plausible, and it cannot be the case that both the traditional scenarios and the reverse-scenarios are all ideally conceivable. Given this one set must be merely prima facie conceivable and only empirical methods will tell us which is which. So, by the time a priori methodology will be of any use it will be too late.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

IIT starts from phenomenological axioms: information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to non-interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as ""differences that make a difference"" within a system, and integrated information as information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information Phi(Max) its quantity. From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true ""zombies"" - unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious complexes.","1553-7358","24811198","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588","","","","e1003588","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

The sample data used to train the feed forward neural networks is generated using NS-2 network simulator running on Linux platform. The generated sample data is divided into training data and test data and MSE is used to compare the performance of various feed forward neural networks.

These were part of the RASP Remote Anthropogenic Sensing Program. Ikonos and Quickbird optical satellite images of sea surface glint revealed approximate to 100 m spectral anomalies in km(2) averaging patches in regions leading from the Honolulu Sand Island Municipal Outfall diffuser to distances up to 20 km. To determine the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, the RASP expeditions monitored the waters adjacent to the outfall with an array of hydrographic, optical and turbulence microstructure sensors in anomaly and ambient background regions. Drogue tracks and mean turbulence parameters for 2 x 10(4) microstructure patches were analyzed to understand complex turbulence, fossil turbulence and zombie turbulence near-vertical internal wave transport processes. The dominant mechanism appears to be generic to stratified natural fluids including planet and star atmospheres and is termed beamed zombie turbulence maser action (BZTMA). Most of the bottom turbulent kinetic energy is converted to approximate to 100 in fossil turbulence waves. These activate secondary (zombie) turbulence in outfall fossil turbulence patches that transmit heat, mass, chemical species, momentum and information vertically to the sea surface for detection in an efficient maser action. The transport is beamed in intermittent mixing chimneys.","","","10.1117/12.732257","","","","","Frouin, RJ|Lee, Z","PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS|(SPIE)","Conference on Coastal Ocean Remote Sensing","AUG 26-27, 2007","San Diego, CA","SPIE","978-0-8194-6828-4","","","","","","","","6"

This re-construction is being developed through reconsidering paradigm, epistemology and methodology operating within a relevant re-constructed practical theology. Theoretical principles are embodied in the use of the qualitative Delphi forecast method, documenting the consensus opinion of 10 informed participants on the possible role of spirituality within the workplace. Building on these accents, some markers are mapped for the further development of the so called recapitalisation of practical theology with emphasis on a possible meaning for the workplace.

As a result, environmentalism is not dead but has become a 'zombie' category. Environmentalism can be reframed to enable more effective engagement with green practices by drawing constructive alignment between discourses of environmentalism and notions of fragmented and malleable identities. Doing so works towards a vocabulary of theory and practice that is sensitive to hybridity and contradiction, whilst retaining the utopian stimulus of conventional environmentalism. Drawing on the terminology of Haraway, 'coyote' environmentalism is one move towards a more productive framing of environmental practice.","","","10.1080/09644016.2010.518684","","","","PII 928401091","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In my analysis, I show how these films repeatedly portray feminized bodies and homes that, when transgressive, are seen as abject until order is re-established at the conclusion of the film. In these horror texts, boundaries dissolve and create potentially progressive moments which can disturb gendered norms and binaries, but ultimately, the boundaries are reified and re-normed, reinscribing patriarchal gender coatings of space.","","","10.1080/09663690600808452","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

This essay shows that a comparative analysis of nightmares can be a productive method for analyzing salient themes in the imaginative products and practices of cultures in close contact. It is argued that zombies, as the first modern monster, are embedded in a set of deeply symbolic structures that are a matter of religious thought. The author draws from her ethnographic work in Haiti to argue that the zonbi is at once part of the mystical arts that developed there since the colonial period, and comprises a form of mythmaking that represents, responds to, and mystifies the fear of slavery, collusion with it, and rebellion against it. In turn, some elements of the Haitian zonbi figure can be found in patterns that haunt recent American zombie films. Zombies in these films are read as figures in a parable about whiteness and death-dealing consumption. This essay suggests that the messianic mood surrounding the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama was consistent with a pattern in zombie films since the 1960s where many zombie-killing heroes are figured as black American males. Zombies are used in both ethnographic and film contexts to think through the conditions of embodiment, the boundaries between life and death, repression and freedom, and the racialized ways in which humans consume other humans.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

This article presents the double movement theorem, drawing upon Polanyi's published and unpublished writings. It explores parallels between his explanation of the advent of the 19th-century free-market regime in Britain and recent Polanyian accounts of the rise of neoliberalism. Following an analysis of the 'pendular' refunctioning of Polanyi's thesis, it closes by asking whether the recent global financial crisis heralds a pendulum swing from neoliberalism (or 'market fundamentalism') towards a form of socially coordinated capitalism, or towards 'more of the same'. As of 2011, it appears that neoliberal policy and ideology remain hegennonic, not in reinvigorated form but as an 'undead' policy regime, one that has spawned a burgeoning literature on 'zombie capitalism' and 'zombie neoliberalism'.","","","10.1177/0011392111426645","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The information gathered still remains intact even if malware uses rootkit techniques to hide its activities. Our framework can be applied for a number of security applications: (1) intrusion detection; (2) rate monitoring/control of external resources; and (3) access control. We show that that the framework is useful even with coarse-grained and simple information. We present some experimental prototypes that employ the framework to detect/control email spam, detect/control DDoS zombie attacks and detect misuse of compute resources. Experimental evaluation shows that the framework is effecting in detecting or limiting the activities of such malware. The growing popularity of multimodal sensors and physical security information management systems suggests that such environmental sensors will become common making our framework cost effective and feasible in the near future.","","","10.1007/s10207-011-0130-9","Yap, Roland/P-7563-2014","Yap, Roland/0000-0002-1188-7474","SI","","","","6th International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication|Networks (SecureComm 2010)","SEP 07-09, 2010","Singapore, SINGAPORE","","","","","","","","","","5"

The difference between modernity and postmodernity is explained in relation to the new sphere of commodification and resourcification, namely, that of life and of all natural living processes. Postmodern media cult-Lire, or popular culture, is peopled by signs of immortality and various kinds of immortals - cyborgs, clones, zombies, immortal human beings and others. Thus, culture accustoms a consumer to immortals and immortality which is concidered as the main goal of a human being and evolution. By nano-bio-technologies and genetic discourse this goal is made scientifically valid, thus reachable. Genetic discourse is becoming the fundamental world-view providing focal landmarks for the emerging future. Media culture supports the spreading of genetic discourse and facilitates its understanding. The temptation by immortality can be considered as a version of modernist ideology of human liberation from various natural, social and heavenly bonds. This liberation, and also secularization, is supported by a scientific genetic technological discourse which is becoming a Stimulating factor of postmodern media production. The genetic explanation of the world is particularly handy for technological reflexivity: the entire world is as if encapsulated into human genes, which become the principle explaining the mystery of life, evolution and the future of humanity, thus rendering power to produce the human proper form and the future of people. All the possibilities stemming from the new genetic and biotech discoveries fell under the regulation of property relations by patenting, thus making ""immortality"" - as a temptation and brand not only an exeptional commodity, but also a political tool and a commodifying force. As the relationships of private property have penetrated natural biogenctic diversity and, having turned it into a resource, the cognitive subject has reached the goal to secularise the Universe, which lie has set for himself. only he as the owner and producer of genes lures people with the eternal shapes of the clones and their genetic information, which will be sustained in any location of the Universe. The temptation by ""immortality"" will become even stronger when the genetic code is mastered. The future of humanity is related to the mixed forms of life, trans-genic or otherwise genetically modified organisms and techno-human forms that will help to postpone, and later to conquer, death. Even thinkers with religious tendencies perceive the technological improvement of human beings as their evolution towards the techno sapiens and consider such a development as all advancement towards the Kingdom of God. The technologization of human beings is imagined in terms of their divination. Yet in this case the character of contemporary science secularising God and obliterating the perception of divinity is overlooked. Two versions of immortality are analyzed more closely - that of Z. Bauman, who links it with the development of computer technologies, and that of J. Baudrillard, who gives a warning that by cloning technologies humanity is trying to inverse the evolution and to return to the undifferentiated state of cells.|The conclusion is drawn that regardless of how we understand 'immortality,' argue over its reality or unreality, all possibilities to prolong human life granted by genetics, informatics and other advances in science and technologies, which support the tempting idea of immortality, have already been penetrated by commodity relationships; therefore, ""imortality"" itself will be available only as a commodity.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

APA was found to actively suppress publicity of malpractice concerns and bad planning in order to sustain a boosterish image of planning. In the process, APA appeared to disregard and violate APA's own Code of Ethics. APA justified its actions with a need to protect APA members' interests, seen as preventing planning and planners from being presented in public in a bad light. The current article argues that it is in members' interest to have malpractice critiqued and reduced, and that this best happens by exposing malpractice, not by denying or diverting attention from it as APA did in this case. Professions, organizations, and societies that stifle critique tend to degenerate and become socially and politically irrelevant ""zombie institutions"". The article asks whether such degeneration has set in for APA and planning. Finally, it is concluded that more debate about APA's ethics and actions is needed for improving planning practice. Nine key questions are presented to constructively stimulate such debate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

If we experience dualistic pain, zombies are possible. On the other hand, if the actual world is physicalistic, zombies are impossible. Based on these conditionals, it is derived that zombies are conceivable but this does not entail their possibility. This line of argument for physicalism is referred to as the Conditional Analysis Strategy (CAS). I claim that the CAS does not help physicalists defuse the zombie argument. To show this, I first suggest that there are three possible interpretations of the strategy: the CAS explains the zombie intuition by virtue of the conceivability of zombies; the CAS conditionally disproves the entailment-link from conceivability to possibility; the CAS unconditionally denies the entailment-link I argue that none of the three understandings brings good news to physicalism.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The candidate demonstrates the degree to which their intellect has developed by the writing of a dissertation. The dissertation is a written scholarly account of the candidate's rigorous research process, the findings and the original theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge.

In effect, the successful PhD is the admission ticket to the rigorous academic world. If the candidate uses questionable means to acquire the degree, the candidate does not get the required benefit of the intellectual development process. With increasing pressure on candidates to complete their degrees within a short time frame, some candidates are project managing the dissertation by outsourcing large aspects of the intellectual work, possible committing academic fraud.

Particularly, attackers can explore vulnerabilities of a cloud system and compromise virtual machines to deploy further large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). DDoS attacks usually involve early stage actions such as multistep exploitation, low-frequency vulnerability scanning, and compromising identified vulnerable virtual machines as zombies, and finally DDoS attacks through the compromised zombies. Within the cloud system, especially the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds, the detection of zombie exploration attacks is extremely difficult. This is because cloud users may install vulnerable applications on their virtual machines. To prevent vulnerable virtual machines from being compromised in the cloud, we propose a multiphase distributed vulnerability detection, measurement, and countermeasure selection mechanism called NICE, which is built on attack graph-based analytical models and reconfigurable virtual network-based countermeasures. The proposed framework leverages OpenFlow network programming APIs to build a monitor and control plane over distributed programmable virtual switches to significantly improve attack detection and mitigate attack consequences. The system and security evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5"

We propose that humanlike robots are not only unnerving, but are so because their appearance prompts attributions of mind. In particular, we suggest that machines become unnerving when people ascribe to them experience (the capacity to feel and sense), rather than agency (the capacity to act and do). Experiment 1 examined whether a machine's humanlike appearance prompts both ascriptions of experience and feelings of unease. Experiment 2 tested whether a machine capable of experience remains unnerving, even without a humanlike appearance. Experiment 3 investigated whether the perceived lack of experience can also help explain the creepiness of unfeeling humans and philosophical zombies. These experiments demonstrate that feelings of uncanniness are tied to perceptions of experience, and also suggest that experience-but not agency-is seen as fundamental to humans, and fundamentally lacking in machines.

Our approach uses routing to redirect all traffic destined to a customer under attack to strategically-located gore proxies, where servers filter out attack traffic and forward authorized traffic toward its intended destination.|Our architecture can be deployed incrementally by individual ISPs, does not require any collaboration between ISPs, and requires no modifications to either server- or client- software. Clients can be authorized through a web interface that screens legitimate users from outsiders or automated zombies. Authenticated clients are granted limited-time access to the network under attack. The gore architecture allows ISPs to offer DDoS defenses as a value-added service, providing necessary incentives for the deployment of such defenses. We constructed a PC-based testbed to evaluate the performance and scalability of gore. Our preliminary results show that gore is a viable approach, as its impact on the filtered traffic is minimal, in terms of both end-to-end latency and effective throughput. Furthermore, gore can easily be scaled up as needed to support larger numbers of clients and customers using inexpensive commodity PCs.","","","","","","","","Zhou, J|Lopez, J|Deng, RH|Bao, F","LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE","8th International Conference on Information Security","SEP 20-23, 2005","Singapore, SINGAPORE","Inst Infocomm Res, Singapore Management Univ","3-540-29001-X","","","","","","","","4"

If the attackers can identify a single vulnerability then, with the use of malicious codes they can compromise that system and makes it a zombie. By compromising a group of computers the attackers can constitute the malicious botnet or zombie army. These are then used to perform a range of devastating attacks. One possible solution to curb the zombie army or malicious botnet is by detecting and blocking or dropping the reconnaissance scan, otherwise port scan. Numerous port scanning techniques are available today.

Truthfulness in science should be an iron|law, not a vague aspiration","Charlton, Bruce G.","","Charlton, BG","MEDICAL HYPOTHESES","0306-9877","NOV","2009","73","5","633","635","Anyone who has been a scientist for more than a couple of decades will realize that there has been a progressive and pervasive decline in the honesty of scientific communications. Yet real science simply must be an arena where truth is the rule; or else the activity simply stops being science and becomes something else: Zombie science. Although all humans ought to be truthful at all times; science is the one area of social functioning in which truth is the primary value, and truthfulness the core evaluation. Truth-telling and truth-seeking should not, therefore, be regarded as unattainable aspirations for scientists, but as iron laws, continually and universally operative. Yet such is the endemic state of corruption that an insistence on truthfulness in science seems perverse, aggressive, dangerous, or simply utopian. Not so: truthfulness in science is not utopian and was indeed taken for granted (albeit subject to normal human imperfections) just a few decades ago. Furthermore, as Jacob Bronowski argued, humans cannot be honest only in important matters while being expedient in minor matters: truth is all of a piece. There are always so many incentives to lie that truthfulness is either a habit or else it declines. This means that in order to be truthful in the face of opposition, scientists need to find a philosophical basis which will sustain a life of habitual truth and support them through the pressure to be expedient (or agreeable) rather than honest. The best hope of saving science from a progressive descent into Zombiedom seems to be a moral Great Awakening: an ethical revolution focused on re-establishing the primary purpose of science: which is the pursuit of truth. Such an Awakening would necessarily begin with individual commitment, but to have any impact it would need to progress rapidly to institutional forms. The most realistic prospect is that some sub-specialties of science might self-identify as being engaged primarily in the pursuit of truth, might form invisible colleges, and (supported by strong ethical systems to which their participants subscribe) impose on their members a stricter and more honest standard of behaviour. From such seeds of truth, real science might again re-grow. However, at present, I can detect no sign of any such thing as a principled adherence to perfect truthfulness among our complacent, arrogant and ever-more-powerful scientific leadership - and that is the group of which a Great Awakening would need to take-hold even if the movement were originated elsewhere.

Of these, role-play is probably the crucial adaptation which makes us most different from other apes. Human childhood, a sheltered period of 'extended irresponsibility', allows us to develop our powers of make-believe and role-play, prerequisites for human cooperation, culture, and reflective consciousness. Social mirror theory originating with Dilthey Baldwin, Cooley and Mend, holds that there cannot be mirrors in the mind without mirrors in society. I will present evidence from the social and behavioural sciences to argue that self-awareness depends on social mirrors and shared experiential worlds. The dependence of reflectivity on shared experience requires some reframing of the 'hardproblem', and suggests a non-trivial answer to the zombie question.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In our approach, Mori's graph would be divided into a left-hand machine field whose beings are deprived of a soul, and a right-hand human being field. The uncanny effect attached to a highly biomimetic robot would find its origin in a cognitive dissonance faced with a machine felt to be too close to the bound between these two fields. Heider's balance theory is considered to specify the task dependency of the uncanny valley, which can be expressed by associating to the uncanny valley effect - and so to the uncanny valley depth according to Mori's graph image - a ""balance degree"" of the social situation in which the human-like machine is involved.","","","10.2316/Journal.206.2011.3.206-3348","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired.|In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","","","","","","","1st IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, Networks,|and Applications (CPSNA)","AUG 19-20, 2013","Taipei, TAIWAN","IEEE","978-1-4799-0798-4","","IEEE","","","","","","4"

Working memory is of central importance for acquiring knowledge and involved in a variety of complex cognitive tasks and thus the use of working memory training games can lead to a wide range of significant impacts in peoples' life. The aim of this paper is to shed light on game design decisions that are founded on cognitive and neuropsychological theories, focusing especially on working memory training. We scrutinize the development of working memory game titled Brains vs Zombies that is designed to have transferrable impact on brain health and promote physical health in some level. The results of two small-scale pilot studies in which the implementation of Brains vs Zombies tablet game were studied are reported. The paper focus especially on user interface solutions of the game comparing button and motion based solutions. The results indicated that the opinions about the user interface solutions varied, but children appreciated the motion based user interface more than older university students.

According to the renowned German psychopathologist, perceptions are corporeal and originate in the exterior objective space while representations are incorporeal and are derived from the interior subjective world. From his point of view, physicalness-imagination, exterior space-interior space', are absolute oppositions that permanently separate perception and representation by an abysm that allows no transition. For Amaral the confusion derives from the German word for perception ""wahrnehmung"", composed by the noun wahr (truth) and by the verb nehmen (take as). In this manner and according to the language, anything that we consider true is necessarily treated as a perception. Nothing is more natural that German thinkers would loose, from such terminology, some flexibility in the evaluation of the phenomenon. Amaral has also reminded that Wundt, in 1874, already distinguished between sensation where stimuli not yet differentiated are perceived; perception, when stimuli organize themselves in a more or less defined manner, and apperception, where an attribution of meaning and a comprehension of the perceived scene or situation occurs.|Crick and Koch propose aspects of great relevance to understand the so called Neural Correlates of the Conscience. They propose that the main function of the sensory cortex is to construct and use feature or specific qualities detectors such as those activated for orientation, movements, and face identification. Therefore, we may affirm that most of the sensory and motor activities are already made and available in the entire cerebral cortex, in the manner of what Changeux has called previous global representations. The conscious qualification process of the different sensory hues and their progressive complexity is a progressive feature, which in the phylogenetic evolution leads to the Homo sapiens sapiens. In fact, in the so called conscious media promoted by the thalamo-cortical activation that is performed in a task that requires effort and attention, we find spontaneously co-activated neural structures coordinated in time and space of the previous global representations type, which in turn generate other processes in the CNS.|Hallucination and delusions: Anankastic representations? Since the times of Esquirol, the definition that a hallucination is a perception without object remained unaltered. Only recently, Alonso-Fernandez questioned Esquirol's scheme upon affirming ""a hallucination is anything but a perception without object, because it is not a perception and because it does have an object. Contrary to the sensoperception activity that goes from the outside to the inside, a centripetal psychic function by excellence, the hallucination is produced upon objectivizing a psychic image providing it with sensoriality and subsequently projecting it to the exterior, shortly an objectivizing projection with, a clear centrifugal transit. In addition, today it is accepted that hallucinatory phenomena exist in sane individuals, related to some personality traits among which the imagination must be highlighted.|The topic of delusion has been the object of the most varied reflections. In our case, we are interested in studying the phenomenon whereby the delusion installs itself in the center of the patient's life as a mineralized representation of the world and of himself, until structuring most of his behavior and relations, which we propose to call anankastic representation. To understand the phenomenon, we believe fundamental Llopis' idea that nature does not possess different laws to produce similar phenomena, therefore, both the delusion and hallucinations observed in the different clinical entities must obey the same pathogenetic mechanism, whereby thought and perception disorders, in reality, are not different disorders qualitatively but only ways of expressing the different degrees of intensity in a disorder.|From the psycho-physiological point of view, it must be underlined that what is activated in the hallucinatory phenomenon is a sensory network that carries a threatening signal for the patient, which is only possible because it is not under his superior control. Everything indicates that we are then dealing with representations that are presentified before a consciousness that does not recognize them as its own, because they have avoided the coincident mechanism of detection for afferent and re-entry signals that support the conscious perception, according to the findings revealed by contemporary neurobiology. That is a critical aspect of the debate on the manner in which neurophysiology must approach the topic of representations, the information storage, the engrams, and the recognition of memories constituting a person.|Simulation and supervision processes intervene in the different states of consciousness that make global access to the past, present and future possible. The individual is not only the receptor of stimuli derived from the environment, to which he responds from his brain with the innate guidelines registered in his genome, but he is also an agent maker of new realities and conducts. He is a poietic and aulopoietic factor and because of that he has dignity. In the dialogue between genetic endowment and the environment and in the constitution of the epigenetic, consciousness and neuroplasticity are fundamental.|In order for everything to function harmoniously, it would be necessary a balance of activity between the sensory cortex and the primary motor with the association areas scattered all over the cerebral cortex, and arranged from the prefrontal cortex. The constructs contained in previous representations must be reviewed in each opportunity and suffer some circumstantial arrangement or deep transformation, according to the case. We are dealing with a metacognition process through which the mind examines its own contents. Whenever a pathological situation alters this process, the constructs can become raw material for hallucinatory-delusional contents. The autopoiesis is interrupted and the mental dynamics is trapped by anankastic representations. Crick's zombies, Changeux's previous representation or Tellez's ""timophanias"", independent from the Self, imposed hallucinaiorilly and automatically on a conscience that cannot differentiate them from reality, constitute therefore a symptomatic expression of what we have called mental illness as ananke.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The uncertainties associated with environmental change are difficult to quantify, yet the impacts may be severe. We argue that we cannot so reduce the uncertainty of the science that can definitively end debate about appropriate policy. Instead, we must learn to integrate uncertainty into decision making processes and consider how our near-term actions enable or constrain future options. Presenting a critical approach to defining human and environmental security, we also distinguish between threats and vulnerabilities and their impact. To examine the relationships between security and risk, we draw on two central metaphors. First, the tenets of traditional security are critiqued vis-a-vis Ulrich Beck's ""zombie concepts"" of modernism, which emphasize the state and thereby fail to engage the multiple and interdependent processes of change we now face. In this context, we discuss broadly how new solutions beget increased risk and how new knowledge yields greater uncertainty. Second, using P.H. Liotta's ""boomerang effect,"" we look more narrowly at how policies intended to address some specific dimension of security can undermine other dimensions. When these metaphors are considered as a set of related ideas, it becomes apparent that the world is confronted with socially produced and human-centered vulnerabilities. Further, the potential for local and localized risk has mutated into systemic risk that affects both the ""developing"" and ""developed"" parts of the world. Responses to climated change, in particular, must therefore accommodate thinking in terms of multiple facets of security.","","","10.1007/978-1-4020-8551-2_2","","","","","Liotta, PH|Mouat, DA|Kepner, WG|Lancaster, JM","Nato Science for Peace and Security Series C - Environmental Security","NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Environmental Change and Human|Security","JUN 04-07, 2007","Newport, RI","NATO","978-1-4020-8549-9","","","","","","","","2"

This method is effective because current host audit systems do not maintain enough information to allow association of incoming and outgoing network connections. In this paper, we introduce an inexpensive method that allows both on-line and forensic matching of incoming and outgoing network traffic. Our method associates origin information with each process in the system process table, and enhances the audit information by logging the origin and destination of network sockets. We present implementation results and show that our method can effectively record origin information about the common cases of stepping stone connections and denial of service zombies, and describe the limitations of our approach.","","","","","","","","","","2002 USENIX Annual Technical Conference","JUN 10-15, 2002","MONTEREY, CA","USENIX Assoc","1-880446-00-6","","USENIX|USENIX","","","","","","2"

Methods: Using a representative sample of the U. S. population, the investigators interviewed 1,393 noninstitutionalized adult participants in the National Stigma Study Children (NSS-C) ( response rate 70%; margin of error +/- 4%). Results: Many respondents believed that stigma results from mental health treatment during childhood (45% reported likely rejection at school) and that stigma continues to have negative ramifications into adulthood (43%). More than half (57%) were skeptical about confidentiality, and more than one-third (35%) expected parents of children with mental illness to experience self-stigma. Most respondents believed that psychiatric medications affect development (68%), give children a flat, ""zombie""-like affect (53%), and delay solving ""real""behavior-related problems (66%). Most (86%) believed that physicians overmedicate children for common behavioral problems. Women and persons with more education rather than less perceived less stigma resulting from treatment but reported more negative views on medication. Beliefs in medication efficacy and trust in physicians were associated with more positive cultural beliefs. Conclusions: Data on the contemporary cultural context surrounding treatment for children's mental health issues revealed substantial stigma concerns, particularly surrounding medication options. These beliefs and attitudes cannot be easily inferred from adults' sociodemographic characteristics.","","17463340","10.1176/appi.ps.58.5.613","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5"

Dementia is a challenging illness, and BPSD can be very difficult for carers to manage, with evidence that this contributes to carer strain and can result in the early institutionalisation of people with dementia. As a result, the prescription of antipsychotic and other neuroleptic medications to treat BPSD has become commonplace, in spite of these drugs being untested and unlicensed for use to treat older people with dementia. In recent years, it has become apparent through clinical trials that antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and death in people with dementia. In addition, these types of medication also have other risk factors for people with dementia, including over-sedation and worsening of cognitive function. Drawing on recent questionnaire (n 185), focus group (n 15), and interview (n 11) data with carers of people with dementia, this paper explores the law relating to off-label prescription, and the applicability of medical negligence law to cases where adverse events follow the use of antipsychotic medication. It is argued that the practice of off-label prescribing requires regulatory intervention in order to protect vulnerable patients.","","23047844","10.1093/medlaw/fws029","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Consistent with research showing that intergroup cooperation leads to reductions in intergroup bias, playing a video game cooperatively with a member of a different social group (i.e., an outgroup member) may reduce bias. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to test whether playing a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup member reduces intergroup bias toward that partner's group. Method: In our investigation, Canadians (n = 138) played a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup (American) or ingroup member against alien (i.e., zombie-like) enemies. Results: Cooperating with an outgroup member in a violent context for only 12 minutes generated large reductions in outgroup prejudice.

This gives many studies on consciousness a particular relevance to religious belief. Many writers assume that, if consciousness can be explained physically, religious belief in a soul- and perhaps religious belief itself-must be false. Theorists of consciousness grapple with questions of materialism and reduction in trying to understand how the physical brain can produce the bizarre sensations that we call ourselves. In this essay I discuss the problems in trying to separate religion from science in such a ""fuzzy"" area as consciousness. I look at the question of what precisely theories of consciousness are trying to explain. I consider theories from David Chalmers, Daniel Dennett, and Roger Penrose as examples of different approaches. Although all of these are materialistically based, I argue that they do not necessarily demonstrate the nonexistence of a soul and also that religious belief does not necessarily require belief in a nonmaterial soul. I conclude with a discussion of why a physical/materialist explanation of consciousness is desired and how religious bias is still a problem in this scientific/philosophical field.","","","10.1111/j.1467-9744.2005.00738.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Improvements in development seemed to be in response to subsequent interventions. At 5 years, she had borderline intellectual functioning, an expressive or receptive language disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.|Suzanna experienced an abrupt developmental decline at 6 1/2 years old. She lost cognitive abilities, and she no longer carried on conversations. Although she was no longer interactive with most people, she remained affectionate with her parents. Her mother thought that Suzanna had visual and auditory hallucinations. In addition, she developed encopresis and hand flapping.

Her Full Scale IQ dropped from 73 to 50 with decreased adaptive functioning and clinically significant problems with hyperactivity, attention, and functional communication.|Suzanna's development stabilized temporarily during an 18-month period. A second period of declining function included ""zombie-like"" behavior, anxiety, and hallucinations. Weekly sessions in child psychiatry included treatment with risperidone, methylphenidate, and supportive therapy for mother and child. After some clinical improvements in behavior, attention, and functioning, a psychological assessment confirmed the persistence of moderate mental retardation.

The information gathered still remains intact even if malware use rootkit techniques to hide its activities. Due to requirements on user privacy, the information gathered could be coarse and simple. We show that such simple information is already useful in several experimental evaluations. For instance, binary user presence indicating at a workstation can help to detect DDoS zombie attacks and illegal email spam. Our framework takes advantage of the growing popularity of multimodal sensors and physical security information management systems.

Neoliberal projects draw political import from systemic, universalizing tendencies in capitalism, particularly those ideological processes by which contradictions and crises come to be discursively, institutionally, and politically conceptualized within the same paradigm from which they emerged. Building on well developed research frameworks in neoliberalism studies, we propose a set of analytical tools to interpret links between particular projects and homogenizing practices.

In this view, even simple tasks, such as distinguishing a rotated T from a rotated L, require selective attention since they require feature binding. Selective attention, in turn, is commonly conceived as involving volition, intention, and at least implicitly, awareness. There is something non-intuitive about the notion that we might need so expensive (and possibly human) a resource as conscious awareness in order to perform so basic a function as perception. In fact, we can carry out complex sensorimotor tasks, seemingly in the near absence of awareness or volitional shifts of attention (""zombie behaviors""). More generally, the tight association between attention and awareness, and the presumed role of attention on perception, is problematic. We propose that under normal viewing conditions, the main processes of feature binding and perception proceed largely independently of top-down selective attention. Recent work suggests that there is a significant loss of information in early stages of visual processing, especially in the periphery. In particular, our texture tiling model (TTM) represents images in terms of a fixed set of ""texture"" statistics computed over local pooling regions that tile the visual input. We argue that this lossy representation produces the perceptual ambiguities that have previously been as ascribed to a lack of feature binding in the absence of selective attention. At the same time, the TTM representation is sufficiently rich to explain performance in such complex tasks as scene gist recognition, pop-out target search, and navigation. A number of phenomena that have previously been explained in terms of voluntary attention can be explained more parsimoniously with the TTM. In this model, peripheral vision introduces a specific kind of information loss, and the information available to an observer varies greatly depending upon shifts of the point of gaze (which usually occur without awareness). The available information, in turn, provides a key determinant of the visual system's capabilities and deficiencies. This scheme dissociates basic perceptual operations, such as feature binding, from both top-down attention and conscious awareness.","","22347200","10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00013","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

According to some recent treatments, the role is surprisingly indirect. Conscious visual experience, on these accounts, serves the formation of plans and the selection of action types and targets, while the control of 'online' visually guided action proceeds via a quasi-independent non-conscious route. In response to such claims, critics such as (Wallhagen [2007], pp. 539-61) have suggested that the notions of control and guidance invoked are unacceptably vague, and that that the image of 'zombie systems' guiding action fails to take account of the possibility that there is genuine but unconceptualized, unnoticed, and/or unreportable experience taking place and guiding or controlling the actions. I address both sets of concerns. I try to show that refining and clarifying the key notions of control and guidance leaves the original argument intact, as does the appeal to unconceptualized, unnoticed, or unreportable experiences. The exercise serves, however, to highlight an important complex of considerations concerning the relations between control, agency, and experience. Better understanding these relations is, I suggest, an important source of insights concerning the nature of phenomenal experience.","","","10.1093/bjps/axm030","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Botnets infect PCs on a huge scale by initially scanning the service ports of vulnerable applications for the purpose of propagation, which is leveraged as the size of the botnet increases. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to detect botnet-propagation activities early and to determine the expectedsize of the attack. To address this issue, this paper proposes to recreate botnets' port-scanning patterns using a simple text classifier that represents these patterns as a kind of matrix. The patterns obtained are then used to train a hidden Markov model and to perform early detection using the trained model. Early detection is achievable by catching the onset of suspicious propagation immediately, and a size estimate is obtained by monitoring fluctuations in botnet size. With this approach, early-detection rates increased to more than 30.6% on average, with a low false negative rate (less than 6%) and an F-measure greater than 96%. This significant improvement in performance will contribute to preventing botnet propagation in its earliest stages.

The popularity of the zombie reflects the after-effects of the anti-authoritarianism of the 1960s. As holes appeared in what Peter Berger called the sacred canopy, previously held systems of meaning collapsed, leaving a growing uncertainty about life and death. In many cases, these holes were filled by alternative spiritualities and Eastern philosophy. I will demonstrate, using Martin Heidegger, how the modern zombie acts as a vessel for Buddhist teachings.

To probe such users thus becomes critically important for a healthy Weibo, but the existing studies along this line are still in initial stage due to the serious lack of labeled zombies and the limited attributes for user profiling. In light of this, in this paper, we figure out a commercial way for training set labeling, and propose a two-stage cascading model called ProZombie for zombie user recognition. ProZombie decomposes the training/predicting process into fast and refined phases in cascade, which greatly improves the modeling efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover, 35 attributes including 16 newly proposed ones are employed for a panoramic description of Weibo users. Experiments on real-world labeled Weibo users demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProZombie. More interestingly, two case studies based on ProZombie successfully unveil the zombies hidden around common users, and their impact to information propagation on Weibo.

It is argued that both premises of the zombie argument - the conceivability of zombies and the conceivability-possibility thesis - cannot be made simultaneously plausible without additional argument in support of one of the premises. The best strategy for the proponent of the zombie argument is identified as limiting the conceivability-possibility thesis to an idealized notion of conceivability, and arguing separately for the conceivability of zombies in this idealized sense. Out of Chalmers' main arguments, the argument from epistemic asymmetry and the argument from absence of analysis are considered in this role. It is argued that, while either of the arguments would, if sound, be appropriate for the role, the first is subject to decisive counter-arguments. The second, on the other hand, is found not only suitable to support the zombie argument, but also more convincing in that its premises are less controversial. Since the argument from absence of analysis also establishes the falsity of physicalism directly by itself if sound, it can be seen to render the zombie argument redundant.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Here I argue that both phenomenal and natural kind terms are ambiguous between two senses, phenomenal and natural, and that the conceivability argument goes through only on one reading of a term. Thus, the antimaterialist has to provide some reasons independent of anti-materialism itself to favour that reading of a term that supports his or her argument. Given that there are no such independent reasons, I conclude that we should put more weight on empirical considerations than on a priori discussion in resolving the question concerning the identity between a phenomenal state and its neural realiser.","","","10.1007/s10670-012-9368-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

It also uses the perspective provided by this material to re-interpret a key episode in the history of the region - the clashes between Christian converts and wider Pedi society in the 1860s. The article concludes that concern about witches was profound and pervasive and needs to be given much fuller attention in historical analysis. However, it also argues that the incidence of individuals being either openly accused of, or punished for, witchcraft was low, and that large-scale and lethal witch-hunts were extremely rare. It further suggests that the contemporary, tendency to see women as particularly prone to witchcraft is not paralleled in nineteenth century, accounts and may therefore be the result of processes of social change set in motion late in the century. In addition, it notes that the 'zombies' who have commanded widespread comment and concern in recent years are probably neither as exotic nor as new as some writers have supposed.","","18630385","10.1080/13632430120074527","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The present study investigated the specificity of this idea by comparing an ancestor-consistent scenario and a modern survival scenario that involved threats that were encountered by human ancestors (e.g., predators) or threats from fictitious creatures (i.e., zombies). Participants read one of four survival scenarios in which the environment and the explicit threat were either consistent or inconsistent with ancestrally based problems (i.e., grasslands-predators, grasslands-zombies, city-attackers, city-zombies), or they rated words for pleasantness. After rating words based on their survival relevance (or pleasantness), the participants performed a free recall task. All survival scenarios led to better recall than did pleasantness ratings, but recall was greater when zombies were the threat, as compared to predators or attackers. Recall did not differ for the modern (i.e., city) and ancestral (i.e., grasslands) scenarios. These recall differences persisted when valence and arousal ratings for the scenarios were statistically controlled as well. These data challenge the specificity of ancestral priorities in survival-processing advantages in memory.","","21327372","10.3758/s13423-011-0060-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Twitter interactions and social experience are particularly challenging to make sense of because of the wide range of tools used to access Twitter (text message, website, iPhone, TweetDeck and others), and the emergent set of practices for annotating message context (hashtags, reply to's and direct messaging). Further, Twitter is used as a back channel of communication in a wide range of contexts, ranging from disaster relief to watching television. Our study examines Twitter as a transport protocol that is used differently in different sociotechnical contexts, and presents an analysis of how researchers might begin to approach studies of Twitter interactions with a more reflexive stance toward the application programming interfaces (APIs) Twitter provides. We conduct a careful review of existing literature examining socio-technical phenomena on Twitter, revealing a collective inconsistency in the description of data gathering and analysis methods. In this paper, we present a candidate architecture and methodological approach for examining specific parts of the Twittersphere. Our contribution begins a discussion among social media researchers on the topic of how to systematically and consistently make sense of the social phenomena that emerge through Twitter.

By attending to the trilogy's entangled temporalities and tactile imagery, I argue that Barker represents wartime England as haunted by a postwar incarnation of itself so unrecognizable that it is anticipated in apocalyptic terms. Through an extended analysis of the relationship between Billy Prior and Sarah Lumb, I posit that Barker connects the politics of remembrance to the politics of social reproduction. Her foregrounding of ""cyborgian"" (Brannigan) working-class femininities and zombie-esque masculinities-materialized, respectively, in landscapes of iron and mud-not only underscores the failures and limits of supposedly regenerative heterosexual intimacy in the context of war. It also displaces fecundity from the heterosexual couple onto the apocalyptic landscape itself, mapping the anticipation of a mutant and misshapen body politic onto England as a site of ruin, decay, and haunting. By reanimating the trench imagery of the soldier poets and extending it to the home front, Barker's trilogy participates in what Roger Simon calls ""public time,"" in which testament is taken up as a ""difficult inheritance"" and reoriented toward a more just future.","","","10.1093/cww/vpq022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Thus, the need of the hour is the early detection and identification of the heart of network packet flooding or the C&C centre. Most of the botmasters perform DDos attacks on a target server by spoofing the source IP address. The existing botnet detection techniques rely on machine learning algorithms and do not expound the IF spoofing issue. These approaches are also found to be unsuccessful in the meticulous identification of the botmasters. Here we propose an architecture that depend on the PSO-based tracebacking. Our architecture also introduces the IP spoofing detector unit so as to ensure that the Traceback moves in the right direction. The approach also detects the zombies and utilizes the PSO optimization technique that aid in the identification of the C&C node.

Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the detection of the compromised machines in a network that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the developed SPOT system using a two-month e-mail trace collected in a large US campus network. Our evaluation studies show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the e-mail trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only seven internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT. In addition, we also compare the performance of SPOT with two other spam zombie detection algorithms based on the number and percentage of spam messages originated or forwarded by internal machines, respectively, and show that SPOT outperforms these two detection algorithms.","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6"

Specifically, we develop semantics and type systems for the constructs of the Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME) programming model; our results apply also to other constructs, such as atomic blocks. With this semantics as a point of reference, we study several implementation strategies. We model STM systems that use in-place update, optimistic concurrency, lazy conflict detection, and roll-back. These strategies are correct only under non-trivial assumptions that we identify and analyze. One important source of errors is that some efficient implementations create dangerous ""zombie"" computations where a transaction keeps running after experiencing a conflict; the assumptions confine the effects of these computations.","","","","","","SI","","","","35th Annual ACM SIGPLAN/SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming|Language","JAN 10-12, 2008","San Francisco, CA","ACM SIGPLAN, ACM SIGACT, Intel, Microsoft Res","","","","","","","","","4"

The above attacks will be threats to the computer systems. This article focuses on the defense mechanism for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks use a lot of request packets or garbage packets to occupy network bandwidth and consume performance of the target host. If the attack target is a commercial website, DDoS attacks will cause transmission delay and more seriously they will deny web services. In this paper, we propose a Double Check Priority Queue structure that effectively mitigates the impact of DDoS attacks in order that normal users can still access services.","1868-5145","","10.1007/s12652-011-0091-x","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5"

This algorithm allows the type checker to automatically use equality assumptions from the context when reasoning about equality. Most dependentlytyped languages automatically use equalities that follow from beta-reduction during type checking; however, such reasoning is incompatible with congruence closure. In contrast, ZOMBIE does not use automatic beta-reduction because types may contain potentially diverging terms. Therefore ZOMBIE provides a unique opportunity to explore an alternative definition of equivalence in dependentlytyped language design.|Our work includes the specification of the language via a bidirectional type system, which works ""up-to-congruence,"" and an algorithm for elaborating expressions in this language to an explicitly typed core language. We prove that our elaboration algorithm is complete with respect to the source type system, and always produces well typed terms in the core language. This algorithm has been implemented in the ZOMBIE language, which includes general recursion, irrelevant arguments, heterogeneous equality and datatypes.","1558-1160","","10.1145/2676726.2676974","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

In experiment I, a computer based software was designed in which participants had to choose to enter one of four rooms in an abandoned house search for a zombie every 3-15 s. Zombies could be found in only one of these rooms every trial in 3 min periods during the 12 min sessions. After 4 training sessions, participants were exposed to a probe session in which zombies could be found in any room on every trial. Almost all participants behaved as if they were timing the availability intervals: they anticipated the changes in the location of the zombie and they persisted in their performance patterns during the probe session; however, verbal reports revealed that they were counting the number of trials in each period in order to decide when to switch between rooms. In the second experiment, the task was modified in two ways: counting was made harder by using three different intertrial ranges within each session: 2-6s, 2-11 s and 2-16 s. Second, labels were displaced during the final session to assess whether participants learned to click on a given place or to follow a set of verbal cues. We found that participants did not notice the label changes suggesting that they learned to click on a given place, and that a win/stay-lose/shift strategy was clearly used to decide when to switch rooms in the second experiment. The implications of verbal behavior when assessing time-place learning with humans and the possible differences in this process between humans and animals are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Against understandings of neoliberalism as a utopian representation projected onto an external reality, I argue that neoliberal ideology operates as a social fantasy, which structures reality itself against the traumatic Real of Capital. The evolution of the neoliberal project should be understood, not as the meticulous manipulation of social reality, but as a series of increasingly desperate attempts to hold the very fabric of reality together. Reconceptualizing neoliberalization as a form of obsessional neurosis can help to explain the relentless persistence of zombie neoliberalism and its paradoxical trajectory towards increasingly intensive forms of social engineering. This argument is developed through a critical engagement with the work of the economist Jeffrey Sachs. From shock therapy to the Millennium Villages Project, Sachs's trajectory embodies the characteristics of the neoliberal neurosis. The paper aims to undermine the apparently monolithic power of neoliberalism, by challenging dominant critical representations of the neoliberal project in terms of a hyper-rational governmentality. It also aims to subvert the attempts by Jeffrey Sachs and other neoliberals to reposition themselves as opponents of the Washington Consensus, and as spokesmen of the Occupy movement. The chosen method of attack is more satirical than polemical. Neurotic neoliberals such as Sachs have successfully appropriated ethical objections to neoliberalism in the name of globalization with a human face. In the present conjuncture, an immanent critique that reveals the internal incoherence of neoliberal ideology, and the hapless floundering of its proponents, is perhaps more effective than a repetition of familiar forms of moral condemnation. An alternative subtitle for this paper might therefore be Towards a satirical materialism.","1467-8330","","10.1111/anti.12058","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Engineers, and in particular IT professionals, are being called on to take more and more consideration of nontechnical factors when designing their systems. Every system they design is meant to be used (ultimately) by people, and yet people are very diverse and work in unexpected ways. We see this in the manager's role in dealing with his employees, where he now has to cater for their safety, recruitment terms, and what facilities they can and cannot use within the business, for example private e-mail. Information technology itself provides new problems, such as zombies, spam and identity theft. Most importantly, businesses now accumulate vast quantities of digital personal data on their customers. Who is to say how they may or may not use this? Does the IT professional not have a say in what is right, even what is legal? The solutions to this have to be worldwide, and yet most of us can only create a local effect. The best place for an academic to start is in training the future engineers.

This has led to the introduction of a theopaschitic paradigm in theory formation. It is argued that the normative task of practical theology implies a philosophical-hermeneutical dimension, that is, to interpret under girding paradigms as related to meaning and being. It also implies a theological dimension; to reflect theologically on the praxis of God as an influential factor within human actions (inhabitational theology.) With reference to 'the pneumatological praxis of God', a practical theology of the intestines is proposed. Bowel categories reveal a divine intentionality (teleology) and describe a modus of God's praxis, the how of God within the vulnerability and suffering of human beings. This divine ontological mode should operate as a practical theological paradigm determining being qualities (ontic status) within human actions and processes of communication. The under girding theological presupposition is that ta splanchna [strong feeling of mercy and compassion expressed by the intestines] denotes a compassionate praxis of co-suffering (the passio Dei). Passion in practical theology emanates in parrhesia and instills a vivid hope: fides quaerens spem [faith in search of hope].","","","10.4102/hts.v67i3.1087","","","","1087","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

From the analysis and the simulation results, we find that the performance of TCP Vegas is much smaller than that of TCP Reno as opposed to an expectation on TCP Vegas. The RED algorithm improves the fairness to some degree, but there still be an inevitable trade-off between fairness and throughput. Accordingly, we propose a ZL-RED (Zombie Listed RED) algorithm, which enhances the RED algorithm to provide fair service for many flows at the bottleneck router. ZL-RED uses the Zombie List, which has been originally proposed by SRED, to detect mis-behaving flows which send packets at higher rate than others. Then, ZL-RED sets higher packet discarding probabilities for those mis-behaving flows. We evaluate an effectiveness of ZL-RED by simulation experiments, and show that ZL-RED can actually improve fairness among TCP connections.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

Borne of exhaustion rather than tiredness, the dream-work lends consistency to a host of fragments drawn from the milieux of spatial science, political economy, poststructuralist philosophy, postmodern sociology, twentieth-century literature, and popular culture. As a work composed in the dead of night, the authors follow Deleuze and Foucault in affirming not the omniscient light of Bentham's generalised, 'all-seeing' Panopticon, but the 'dark light' of the blind power lurking in the shadowy world of the Dark Panopticon. Surprisingly, the exemplary mise-en-sence for the resulting foray into the Heart of Darkness turns out to be the greengrocery that is invariably situated at the gateway to every supermarket and hypermarket. It is here that the authors sense the unbearable violence perpetrated against the flesh of the world-the flesh of soft fruit and animals, no less than the flesh of ourselves and the earth-and it is from here that the revenge of the zombie flesh takes hold (fetishistic depersonalisation and deindividuation). The authors argue that the human being is suspended, undone, and disseminated between the information society and the consumer society. Only our 'en-trails' are left amidst the flesh of the world.

While 28 Days Later displays remarkable similarities to Marxist accounts of the origins and dynamics of capitalism in England, Wild Zero can be seen as an account of the post-1985 dynamics of the Japanese political economy and its engagement with Asia.

Recent headlines should prove that this joke is largely true. Cybercriminals stole the credit-card information and personal data of millions of people from companies that included Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase. Security researchers discovered fundamental flaws in Internet building blocks, such as the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. A massive data-destruction attack sent Sony Pictures Entertainment back to using pen and paper. Criminals accessed the data of more than 80 million customers of health insurance giant Anthem. And these are just the incidents we know about.|In the coming years, cyberattacks will almost certainly intensify, and that is a problem for all of us. Now that everyone is connected in some way to cyberspace through our phones, our laptops, our corporate networks we are all vulnerable. Hacked networks, servers, personal computers and online accounts are a basic resource for cybercriminals and government snoops alike. Your corporate network or personal gaming PC can easily become another tool in the arsenal of criminals or taxpayer-sponsored cyberspies. Compromised computers can be used as step-Ping-stones for the next attack or become part of a ""botnet,"" a malicious network of controlled zombie devices rented out by the hour to launch denial-of-service attacks or distribute spam.|In response to threats such as these, the natural reflex of governments in the U.S. and elsewhere is to militarize cyberspace, to attempt to police the digital world using centralized bureaucracies a:nd secret agencies. But this approach will never work. In fact, for reasons we will get to shortly, it might just make things worse. Cybersecurity is like a public health problem. Government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Con; trol and Prevention have important roles to play, but they cannot stop the spread of diseases on their own. They can only do their job if citizens do theirs.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In this paper I am primarily concerned with the latter issue. The target of this paper is to analyze whether exemplarization, besides explaining epistemic phenomena such as immediate and ineffable knowledge of experiences, can also solve the ontological problem of consciousness. In particular, Lehrer suggests that if we consider exemplarization, zombies cannot provide an argument for anti-physicalism.

Because all known epigenetic pathways act on all TEs, it is likely that the specialized epigenetic regulation of regular host genes (RHGs) was co-opted from this ubiquitous need for the silencing of TEs and viruses. With their internally repetitive and rearranging structures, and the acquisition of fragments of RHGs, the expression of TEs commonly makes antisense RNAs for both TE genes and RHGs. These antisense RNAs, particularly from heterochromatic reservoirs of 'zombie' TEs that are rearranged to form variously internally repetitive structures, may be advantageous because their induction will help rapidly suppress active TEs of the same family. RHG fragments within rapidly rearranging TEs may also provide the raw material for the ongoing generation of miRNA genes. TE gene expression is regulated by both environmental and developmental signals, and insertions can place nearby RHGs under the regulation (both standard and epigenetic) of the TE. The ubiquity of TEs, their frequent preferential association with RHGs, and their ability to be programmed by epigenetic signals all indicate that RGHs have nearly unlimited access to novel regulatory cassettes to assist plant adaptation.","","21444239","10.1016/j.pbi.2011.01.003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

This latter argument aims at showing that zombies, our physical duplicates who lack consciousness, are metaphysically possible, given that they are conceivable. Bercic's first response is based on the principle of the uniformity of nature that states that causes of a certain type will always cause effects of the same type. His second response is based on the assumption that the basic statements of physicalism in philosophy of mind are or should be contingently true. I argue that if Bercic's first defence is aimed at the conceivability of zombies, it is unsatisfactory. Moreover, I argue that a quite similar argument, offered by John Perry in his book Knowledge, Possibility and Consciousness (2001), is afflicted by a similar problem. Nevertheless, under a more plausible interpretation, Bercic's argument might be taken to attack the metaphysical possibility of zombies. This version of the argument might be effective and has the merit to point out a so far overlooked link between the discussion of the Chalmers's conceivability arguments against physicalism and the modal strength of causal links and natural laws. Then, I argue that Bercic's second defence of physicalism, which cannot be combined consistently with his first one, in any case, should not be formulated in the terms of contingent physicalism.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Any disruption of DNS service can have serious consequences. We present a formal game-theoretic analysis of a notable threat to DNS, namely the bandwidth amplification attack (BAA), and the countermeasures designed to defend against it. We model the DNS BAA as a two-player, turn-based, zero-sum stochastic game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker attempts to flood a victim DNS server with malicious traffic by choosing an appropriate number of zombie machines with which to attack. In response, the defender chooses among five BAA countermeasures, each of which seeks to increase the amount of legitimate traffic the victim server processes. To simplify the model and optimize the analysis, our model does not explicitly track the handling of each packet. Instead, our model is based on calculations of the rates at which the relevant kinds of events occur in each state. We use our game-based model of DNS BAA to generate optimal attack strategies, which vary the number of zombies, and optimal defense strategies, which aim to enhance the utility of the BAA countermeasures by combining them in advantageous ways. The goal of these strategies is to optimize the attacker's and defender's payoffs, which are defined using probabilistic reward-based properties, and are measured in terms of the attacker's ability to minimize the volume of legitimate traffic that is processed, and the defender's ability to maximize the volume of legitimate traffic that is processed.","","","10.1109/EDCC.2014.37","","","","","","","10th European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC)","MAY 13-16, 2014","Newcastle upon Tyne, ENGLAND","","978-1-4799-3803-2","","IEEE","","","","","","4"

It takes the practice of detaining 'illegal immigrants' as a starting point for reflection on two central features of debates about globalization: (1) the declining relevance of space and (2) the declining relevance of nation-states. The author argues that both may be taking place, but they are being countered by states adapting themselves to the condition of globalization. By turning itself from welfare state into penal state, the state seeks new ways of defining itself in a globalizing world. This involves the detention centre for 'illegal immigrants' as a space of exception. The author uses three notions in order to capture the nature of the space occupied by the detention centre, which escapes traditional social scientific notions of space. Ranging from the more 'formal' characteristics of the spaces in question to their full political substance, they are Auge's notion of the non-place, Foucault's notion of the heterotopia and Agamben's notion of the camp. The author argues that the global is networked through localities, and that the exceptional space of the detention centre for 'illegal aliens' is a political node in the global network. The incarceration of irregular immigrants as homines sacri is part of a response to the global by means of an absolute relevance of the local: the detention centre, which is at once the model of binding locality and the site of a space 'outside' regular social space.","","","10.1177/0268580909343494","Schinkel, Willem/E-6209-2013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

What displaced people, people without the protection of the state and zombies have in common is that both manifest the quality of what Giorgio Agamben calls 'bare life'. Moreover, zombies have the qualities of workers or slaves driven to total exhaustion. The genre of the zombie apocalypse centres on laying siege to a place that is identified as a refuge for a group of humans. In these texts it is possible to read an equation of zombies with displaced people who are 'threatening' the state. Indeed, the rhetoric used to describe these people constructs them as similar to mythical zombies.

There is another important form of intentionality though that concerns not what there is, but what to do. I call this a guiding form of intentionality. In speech, there are - for example - imperatives and among intentional mental states there are desires and intentions. In this paper I argue that perceptual experience is at least sometimes characterized by such a guiding form of intentionality. Perception does not just inform, it is sometimes intrinsically action-guiding. I call this the perceptual guidance claim. I distinguish the perceptual guidance claim from related, but importantly distinct claims (such as claims concerning the perception of affordances or concerning whether perception is normative), and argue that perceptual action guidance occurs not just in an unconscious vision-for-action system, but also within conscious perceptual experience.","1467-9329","","10.1111/rati.12084","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In comparison to the existing DDoS traceback methods, the proposed strategy possesses a number of advantages-it is memory nonintensive, efficiently scalable, robust against packet pollution, and independent of attack traffic patterns. The results of extensive experimental and simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our experiments show that accurate traceback is possible within 20 seconds (approximately) in a large-scale attack network with thousands of zombies.","","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

And further, given the initial advantages of materialism, the fact that proponents of the zombie argument are not allowed to rely on arguments against materialism in confronting this dilemma, and difficulties with arguments in favor of phenomenism, we find ourselves pushed to reject the mental paint conception rather than materialism.

We point out that this fact makes it necessary to revise popular views about macromolecular functions and distinguish between local, physico-chemical and global, biological functions. Our analysis shows that physico-chemical functions are merely tools of biological functionality. This result sheds new light on the origin of cellular life, indicating that in evolutionary history, assignment of biological functions to cellular ingredients plays a crucial role. In this wider picture, even if aggregation of chance mutations of replicator molecules and spontaneously self-assembled proteins led to the formation of a system identical with a living cell in all physical respects but devoid of biological functions, it would remain an inanimate physical system, a pseudo-cell or a zombie-cell but not a viable cell. In the origin of life scenarios, a fundamental circularity arises, since if cells are the minimal units of life, it is apparent that assignments of cellular functions require the presence of cells and vice versa. Resolution of this dilemma requires distinguishing between physico-chemical and biological symbols as well as between physico-chemical and biological information. Our analysis of the concepts of symbol, rule and code suggests that they all rely implicitly on biological laws or principles. We show that the problem is how to establish physico-chemically arbitrary rules assigning biological functions without the presence of living organisms. We propose a solution to that problem with the help of a generalized action principle and biological harnessing of quantum uncertainties. By our proposal, biology is an autonomous science having its own fundamental principle. The biological principle ought not to be regarded as an emergent phenomenon. It can guide chemical evolution towards the biological one, progressively assigning greater complexity and functionality to macromolecules and systems of macromolecules at all levels of organization. This solution explains some perplexing facts and posits a new context for thinking about the problems of the origin of life and mind.","1875-1350","","10.1007/s12304-013-9173-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Though parasitic manipulation of host behavior is generally assumed to be due to the parasite's gene expression, few studies have set out to test this.|Results: We experimentally infected Carpenter ants to collect tissue from both parasite and host during the time period when manipulated biting behavior is experienced. Upon observation of synchronized biting, samples were collected and subjected to mixed RNA-Seq analysis. We also sequenced and annotated the O. unilateralis s.l. genome as a reference for the fungal sequencing reads.|Conclusions: Our mixed transcriptomics approach, together with a comparative genomics study, shows that the majority of the fungal genes that are up-regulated during manipulated biting behavior are unique to the O. unilateralis s.l. genome. This study furthermore reveals that the fungal parasite might be regulating immune- and neuronal stress responses in the host during manipulated biting, as well as impairing its chemosensory communication and causing apoptosis. Moreover, we found genes up-regulated during manipulation that putatively encode for proteins with reported effects on behavioral outputs, proteins involved in various neuropathologies and proteins involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids.","","26285697","10.1186/s12864-015-1812-x","Brachmann, Andreas/I-2241-2013; de Bekker, Charissa/N-2743-2015","Brachmann, Andreas/0000-0001-7980-8173; ","","620","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8"

On July 7, 2009, twelve websites including the websites of Cheong Wa Dae, the National Assembly, the Ministry of National Defence, top internet portals Daum and Naver, and Auction in South Korea and fourteen websites including the websites of the White House and the State Department in the U.S. were attacked by DDoS collectively. The internet sites of South Korea and the abroad important government offices were attacked by DDoS for the first time simultaneously. Affected or zombie computers for themselves could attack the internet sites of important organizations and agencies.|The first attack was that affected or zombie twenty three thousand PCs in South Korea at 6 p.m. of July 7, 2009 and two thousand PCs abroad helped to attack the websites of important government organizations and agencies. The second attack happened on July 8, 2009. Sixteen thousand zombie PCs were used at the second attack. The third attack was at 6 p.m. of July 9, 2009. Hard diskettes and data in ""zombie PCs"" which were affected by DDoS were destroyed from July 10, 2009. 7 . 7 Cyber Attack. Zombie PCs with malicious codes exploded for themselves from at least thirty thousand to the most sixty thousand zombie PCs. 7 . 7 Cyber Attack was happened by P Company in Seoul and D Company in Busan, South Korea. The two companies were consisted of file sharing sites. Methods for protection of cyber attacks might be considered as measures for level of citizen, for level of government organization, for state level and for level of inter-state level. Developed countries like the U.S. and Japan allocated 10 percent of the total budget even 10 years ago. South Korea was labeled an internet powerhouse, but ironically spent only I percent of its entire annual budget on cyber security. Budget for internet security in South Korea should be increased. Owners of all virus-infected computers should pay immediate attention to cleaning up their operating systems.","","","","","","","","Zhu, XN","","5th International Conference on Public Administration","OCT 23-25, 2009","UESTC, Sch Polit  Sci & Public Adm, Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA","Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Amer Soc Public Adm, Chinese Public Adm Soc, Moscow State Univ, Sch Public Adm, Chinese Public Adm Journal","978-7-5647-0139-0","UESTC, Sch Polit  Sci & Public Adm","","","","","","","1"

In Pays sans chapeau, Vieux Os goes back to his native land after twenty years of absence and discovers a people of zombies of whom he wants to be the reporter. In L'enigme du retour, the return takes place thirty-three years after the initial departure. While the narrator's main objective is apparently to bring home the soul of his father, whose body is in New York, he also has the opportunity to take stock of his own existence, which bears a strange resemblance to his father's. This study of the two novels deals. with the exiled narrator's relation to his native country and to the satutary role of a body of writing dedicated to the primary question that inevitably haunts each new generation of Haitians : stay or leave.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Defining bisexuality in terms of gender-plural sexual desire, it argues that narratives about bisexuals may impose essentializing identities, which resignify and redefine bisexuality through the use of stereotypes and the evasion of the sexuality and plurality of bisexual desire. By doing this, Peters and Hartinger, who represent the ideological middle ground in such narratives, ironically sustain the invisibility of bisexuality that they ostensibly resist. Of the novels by Wilkinson and Ryan, Wilkinson's Pink is the most stereotypical and evasive example, while Ryan's Empress of the World, at the other extreme, manages to avoid essentializing bisexuality, seeing it in terms of plural desires. If narratives of bisexuality are to help bisexual teenagers interpret their plural desires and fill the bisexual spaces or gaps in their worlds, it is argued that this necessitates a shift towards approaches, like Ryan's, that recognize the variety and individuality of these teenagers.","1573-1693","","10.1007/s10583-014-9237-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

As a consequence, botnet detection has become an important research topic in network protection and cyber-crime prevention. P2P botnets are one of the most malicious zombie networks, as their architecture imitates P2P software. Characteristics of P2P botnets include (1) the use of multiple controllers to avoid single-point failure; (2) the use of encryption to evade misuse detection technologies; and (3) the capacity to evade anomaly detection, usually by initiating numerous sessions without consuming substantial bandwidth. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel data mining method. First, we identify the differences between P2P botnet behavior and normal network behavior. Then, we use these differences to tune the data-mining parameters to cluster and distinguish normal Internet behavior from that lurking P2P botnets. This method can identify a P2P botnet without breaking the encryption. Furthermore, the detection system can be deployed without altering the existing network architecture, and it can detect the existence of botnets in a complex traffic mix before they attack. The experimental results reveal that the method is effective in recognizing the existence of botnets. Accordingly, the results of this study will be of value to information security academics and practitioners.","1936-6450","","10.1007/s12083-012-0195-x","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

In 2010 Roberts forcefully responds to Woodman, arguing that Beck's own words and empirical evidence contradict his argument. Woodman responds to Roberts, reasserting his position and asks for the debate to move beyond mere 'quote wars'. This paper engages with this debate, taking Woodman's challenge seriously while maintaining that Beck's jettison of class is problematic, and that the concept of class itself is still vital. The paper concludes with suggestions as to what youth sociologists concerned with socio-economic inequality might want to focus upon in the future.","","","10.1080/13676261.2010.538042","","","","PII 931506118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Whilst generic discourses highlight the use of zombies as a means of accumulating wealth, those accused of witchcraft are nearly always subordinate and impoverished persons who allegedly keep zombies as a means of survival. At the same time, these beliefs are connected to powerful psychological motivations, such as emotionally overwhelming experiences of bereavement, loss, and mourning.

A focus of our study is detecting self-propagating malware such as worms and botnets. We begin by conducting an empirical study of transport- and application-layer failure activity using a collection of long-lived malware traces. We dissect the failure activity observed in this traffic in several dimensions, finding that their failure patterns differ significantly from those of real-world applications. Based on these observations, we describe the design of a prototype system called Netfuse to automatically detect and isolate malware-like failure patterns. The system uses an SVM-based classification engine to identify suspicious systems and clustering to aggregate failure activity of related enterprise hosts. Our evaluation using several malware traces demonstrates that the Netfuse system provides an effective means to discover suspicious application failures and infected enterprise hosts. We believe it would be a useful complement to existing defenses.","","","","","","","","Chen, Y|Dimitriou, TD|Zhou, JY","Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences Social Informatics|and Telecommunications Engineering","5th International ICST Conference on Security and Privacy in|Communication Networks","SEP 14-17, 2009","Athens, GREECE","ICST, CreateNet, Inst Informat Telecommunicat, Greek Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos","978-3-642-05283-5","","","","","","","","3"

Also, previously, hacking and malicious code were carried out for self-display or simple curiosity, but recently they are related to monetary extortion. In order to respond to incidents correctly, it is important to measure the damage to a system rapidly and determine the attack paths.

In India, Hindi cinema is an important source of public information and misinformation about ECT.|Methods: We identified depictions of ECT in Hindi cinema through inquiries with e-communities, video libraries, and other sources. We also searched the PubMed database using search terms related to ECT and movies.|Results: Between 1967 and 2008, 13 Hindi movies contained referrals to or depictions of ECT. By and large, the depictions were inaccurate, distorted, and dramatized. Electroconvulsive therapy was administered to punish, to obliterate identity, to induce insanity, and for other rarely clinically valid indications. Electroconvulsive therapy was almost always administered by force. Premedication was rare. Genuine ECT devices were uncommonly used. Electroconvulsive therapy stimulation almost invariably appeared to cause pain. Multiple shocks were frequently delivered in the same session. The convulsions were usually bizarre. The treatment caused mental disturbance, amnesia, weakness, and even a zombielike state, thought not mortality; clinical improvement was rare. There was no pattern of increasing accuracy of depiction of ECT with recency of movie release.|Discussion: We examine the extent to which the identified inaccuracies are practically important and offer reasons for the inaccuracies. Although the inaccuracies are a cause for concern, we suggest that because Hindi cinema is generally hyperbolic, the public may be willing to distinguish real life from reel life when facing clinical decisions about ECT. Nevertheless, considering the potential for harm in the dissemination of misinformation, filmmakers should exhibit a greater sense of ethics when creating impressions that might adversely influence health.","","20190596","10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181d017ba","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

Measurements of the Birks non-linearity parameter, kB, and the linearised scintillation response of each photomultiplier, omega(i), were made using these data. However, the value of kB that best linearises the scintillator response is found to vary depending upon which photomultiplier is used in its determination, and the measured kB and omega(i); vary depending on the external source geometry. The cause of this behaviour is unknown. The triple-coincident detection efficiency appears to be unaffected by any systematic errors. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is often taken that the former entails the latter and that therefore any implausibility in the notion of conscious epiphenomenalism calls into question the genuine possibility of zombies. Four ways in which the zombist might respond are examined, and I argue that two-those most commonly encountered-are inadequate, but the others-one of which is rarely formulated and the other new-are more forceful. The upshot, nevertheless, is that the zombist may indeed face an unwelcome commitment to conscious epiphenomenalism.","1759-0949","","10.1017/S0012217309090076","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The genus is naturally distributed in the New World, but many species are known world-wide as popular aquarium plants. The views upon species delimitation and infrageneric classification of the genus have been controversial. Phenotypic plasticity of aquatic plants combined with reduced and presumably convergent morphological structures pose serious problems to classification, emphasizing the need for molecular-level data. A simultaneous cladistic analysis of molecular and morphological data was conducted to resolve the phylogeny of the genus. The results showed Echinodorus (as it is currently circumscribed) to be polyphyletic. None of the currently proposed infrageneric classifications of the genus were supported in the light of phylogenetic evidence. Also, many species and subspecies level rankings were found to be unnatural. Monophyly of Echinodorus is ascertained by separating Helanthium and the monotypic genus Albidella from Echinodorus. As a result, two new combinations (Helanthium bolivianum and H. zombiense) are made, and a detailed description of the genus Helanthium is provided.

Due to the unique characteristics of NAND flash memory, SSDs need to accurately understand the liveness of the data stored in themselves. Recently, the TRIM command has been introduced to notify SSDs of dead data caused by file deletions, which otherwise could not be tracked by SSDs. This paper goes one step further and proposes a new liveness state, called the zombie state, to denote live data that will be dead shortly due to the corresponding dirty data in the buffer cache. We also devise new zombie-aware garbage collection algorithms which utilize the information about such zombie data inside SSDs. To evaluate Zombie Chasing, we implement zombie-aware garbage collection algorithms in the prototype SSD and modify the Linux kernel and the Oracle DBMS to deliver the information on the zombie data to the prototype SSD. Through comprehensive evaluations using our in-house micro-benchmark and the TPC-C benchmark, we observe that Zombie Chasing improves SSD performance effectively by reducing garbage collection overhead. Especially, our evaluation with the TPC-C benchmark on the Oracle DBMS shows that Zombie Chasing enhances the Transactions Per Second (TPS) value by up to 22% with negligible overhead.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2013.218","Maeng, Seungryoul/C-1882-2011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Bushbuckridge, I observe that AIDS stigma has been both pervasive and intense. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, I argue that the association of AIDS with sexual promiscuity has not been the major source of its stigma. Instead, I suggest that denial, silence, fear and fatalism have stemmed from the construction of persons living with AIDS as being 'dead before dying', and from their symbolic location in the anomalous domain betwixt-and-between life and death. This article also challenges the notion that older cultural practices in the folk domain impede an effective biomedical response to AIDS. I see the construction of persons with AIDS as 'dead before dying' as an outcome of the manner in which biomedical discourses have articulated with religious and popular ones. In this process the notion that AIDS is a fatal terminal illness carries as much symbolic weight as the popular association of persons suffering from AIDS with lepers and zombies.","","","10.1080/03057070701646944","","","","","","","Hybrids and Partnerships Conference","SEP 15-16, 2005","Oxford Univ, Oxford, ENGLAND","","","Oxford Univ","","","","","","","1"

Hosts' phenotypic changes are multidimensional, and manipulated traits include behavior, neurotransmission, coloration, morphology, and hormone levels. The field of parasitic manipulation of hosts' phenotype has now accrued many examples of systems where parasites manipulate the phenotypes of their hosts and focus has shifted to answering three main questions. First, through what mechanisms do parasites manipulate the hosts' phenotype? Parasites often induce changes in the hosts' phenotypes that neuroscientists are unable to recreate under laboratory conditions, suggesting that parasites may have much to teach us about links between the brain, immune system, and the expression of phenotype. Second, what are the ecological implications of phenotypic manipulation? Manipulated hosts are often abundant, and changes in their phenotype may have important population, community, and ecosystem-level implications. Finally, how did parasitic manipulation of hosts' phenotype evolve? The selective pressures faced by parasites are extremely complex, often with multiple hosts that are actively resisting infection, both in physiological and evolutionary time-scales. Here, we provide an overview of how the work presented in this special issue contributes to tackling these three main questions. Studies on parasites' manipulation of their hosts' phenotype are undertaken largely by parasitologists, and a major goal of this symposium is to recruit researchers from other fields to the study of these phenomena. Our ability to answer the three questions outlined above would be greatly enhanced by participation from individuals trained in the fields of, for example, neurobiology, physiology, immunology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and invertebrate biology. Conversely, because parasites that alter their hosts' phenotype are widespread, these fields will benefit from such study.","1557-7023","24771088","10.1093/icb/icu028","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Contract theory explanations for textualist preferences emphasise either transactional efficiency or relational factors, which do not fit ISDA or the derivatives market. We pose an alternative explanation: the embrace of textualism in this case may be a means for ISDA to reconcile the competing political demands from state regulators and its market constituents. We describe categories of contracts susceptible to such political demands, and consider when and why textualism might be the preferred response.","","","10.1017/S1566752912000274","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

It focuses on South Africa, one of the newest and most admired liberal democracies, and in particular on its efforts to recognize indigenous African traditions surrounding witchcraft and related occult practices. In 2004, Parliament passed a law that purports to regulate certain occult practitioners called traditional heaters. Today, lawmakers are under pressure to go further and criminalize the practice of witchcraft itself. This Article presses two arguments. First, it contends that the 2004 statute is compatible with liberal principles of equal citizenship and the rule of law. Second, it warns against outlawing witchcraft as such. Subjecting suspected sorcerers to criminal punishment based on governmental determinations of guilt that many will perceive to be unprincipled would work too much damage to individual autonomy and national unity, among other values. These arguments are designed to contribute to a wider discussion about the capacity of liberalism to respond to the global resurgence of religious traditionalism, especially in countries where traditionalists may comprise a large majority of the citizenry.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Both physicalists and anti-physicalists presuppose that two physical systems can be functionally identical, but different in respect to possessing consciousness. However, this intuition is precisely what functionalists contest. Therefore anti-functionalist arguments can only be successful if there would be given at least one scientifically plausible thought experiment showing what such system might possibly look like. The article is concluded with the analysis of Ned Block's famous thought experiment of a Chinese nation, which collectively governs a brainless body. This analysis is intended to show that this system will not be functionally identical to a human body and therefore it cannot be used as a decisive argument against functionalism.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Although it is commonly argued that zombies, like all monsters, are manifestations of 'collective nightmares', for hardcore punks hanging out in Detroit in the early 1980s the performance of zombie scenarios can be better understood as the theatricalization of lived experience and an attempt to work through the fluid relationships between roles and participants.","2040-0616","","10.1080/14682761.2014.961363","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Yet the force fields of the interests of three great powers the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Germany also intersected in Estonia. The communist Soviet Union, with a population 150 times larger than that of Estonia, and Nazi Germany, with a population 60 times larger than Estonia's, were considered threats to security in Estonia. The democratic United Kingdom, on the other hand, was considered Estonia's greatest friend and influential supporter. This article considers the attitudes and actions of these three great powers in 1933 and 1934.|The United Kingdom had practically no interest whatsoever in influencing Estonian domestic politics and it is a known fact that it did not make a single attempt to do so. The reason for this was the low priority of the Baltic region in London's view. London was primarily interested in restraining Germany's influence in the Baltic region and in Estonia's domestic conditions only as far as they related to that background. Information concerning Estonia was deficient and policymakers in London most likely believed for some time prior to and after the coup that the members of the movement of veterans of Estonia's war of independence had close connections to Germany's Nazis, and Konstantin Pats and Johan Laidoner carried out the coup to prevent them from taking power.|The limited steps taken by the Soviet Union's People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs aimed at supporting Pats in the election for Head of State turned out to be ineffective and were implemented too late, and thus did not improve Pats's chances to any significant degree. Economic leverage was not used. The Estonian Communist Party was a zombie organisation, which was a subordinate branch of the Comintern, which was in turn directed by the Kremlin. At best, the Estonian Communist Party could perhaps destabilise Estonia's domestic politics, but it could not direct it. The cooperation of Estonian socialists with Moscow doubtless exacerbated Estonia's domestic political situation but not decisively. Thus the Soviet Union's interference was not determinative in Estonia's loss of democracy.|Even though there is less certainty concerning Berlin's policy due to a lack of available information, it appears that Germany's attempts to influence Estonia's domestic politics in its preferred direction were also limited in scope. Similarly to the Soviet Union, Germany's options were limited because Germany was also seen as a threat to security in Estonia, and Germany's threats or obvious attempts at ""positive involvement"" could have disposed the people against pro-German politicians altogether. In summary, the article concludes that the coup of 1934 was the result of Estonia's domestic political processes.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

This so-called zombie or brain-manipulating fungus alters the behaviour of the ant host, causing it to die in an exposed position, typically clinging onto and biting into the adaxial surface of shrub leaves. We (HCE and DPH) are currently undertaking a worldwide survey to assess the taxonomy and ecology of this highly variable species.|Methods: We formally describe and name four new species belonging to the O. unilateralis species complex collected from remnant Atlantic rainforest in the south-eastern region (Zona da Mata) of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Fully illustrated descriptions of both the asexual (anamorph) and sexual (teleomorph) stages are provided for each species. The new names are registered in Index Fungorum (registration. indexfungorum.org) and have received IF numbers. This paper is also a test case for the electronic publication of new names in mycology.|Conclusions: We are only just beginning to understand the taxonomy and ecology of the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis species complex associated with carpenter ants; macroscopically characterised by a single stalk arising from the dorsal neck region of the ant host on which the anamorph occupies the terminal region and the teleomorph occurs as lateral cushions or plates. Each of the four ant species collected - Camponotus rufipes, C. balzani, C. melanoticus and C. novogranadensis - is attacked by a distinct species of Ophiocordyceps readily separated using traditional micromorphology. The new taxa are named according to their ant host.","","21399679","10.1371/journal.pone.0017024","Elliot, Simon/A-5557-2013","","","e17024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

We hypothesized that the sonar system would be more fun, as it provided a playful challenge. Unlike most auditory games for the blind, which typically use screen readers, we made high quality voice recordings of the entire user interface for our game. Overall, results did not show that the sonar based game was more fun, however our game was rated so highly by users, that the navigation system itself appears less important than careful user design and innovative and fun auditory feedback.","","","","","","","","","","12th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and|Accessibility","OCT 25-27, 2010","Orlando, FL","ACM SIGACCESS","978-1-60558-881-0","","","","","","","","3"

This argument bears adversely on an important argument offered by Balog (1999), and some arguments given in support of her view can be re-targeted as arguments against my conclusion. These arguments are reviewed and answered.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The flocking of birds is a natural phenomenon, which is formed and organized without central or external controls for some benefits (e. g., reduction of energy consummation). However, the flocking also has some negative effects on the human, as the infectious disease H7N9 will easily be transmited from the denser flocking birds to the human. Zombie-city model has been proposed to help analyzing and modeling the flocking birds and the artificial society. This paper focuses on the H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and from the flocking birds to the human. And some interesting results have been shown: (1) only some simple rules could result in an emergence such as the flocking; (2) the minimum distance between birds could affect H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and even affect the virus transmissions from the flocking birds to the human.","","","10.1155/2013/196823","","","","196823","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

Thus, the film is discussed as a self-referential mixture of genres, that combines dystopia with apocalypse, utopia with the pastoral, and that ironically undercuts all its generic statements.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Because of uneven write distribution, PCM is highly likely to have early failures, which can spread over the chip space and leave the entire chip unusable. Wear leveling is an indispensable technique to even out wear caused by the writes. However, because of process variation early failure cannot be fully avoided. State-of-the-art wear-leveling schemes, such as Start-Gap and Security Refresh, cease to function once even a single block failure occurs because their designs require persistent writable address space for wear leveling operations. Existent solutions attempting to address the problem demand substantial OS supports, such as explicit space allocations and data migrations. The demand on substantial OS cooperation creates a barrier to widespread adoption of the PCM technique.|While fault-tolerance techniques, such as FREE-p and zombie, that remap failed blocks to inaccessible but healthy space have the potential to address the wear-leveling issue by relocating data from failed blocks to healthy ones, they cannot work together with the wear-leveling schemes as data migration may change placement of relocated data. In this paper, we propose a framework, WL-Reviver, that allows any in-PCM wear-leveling scheme to keep delivering its designed leveling service even after failures occur in its working address space. The design is unique on two aspects: (1) it leverages the fault-tolerance techniques so that they can work together with the wear-leveling schemes; and (2) it requires no OS supports additional to what're available to today's DRAM-based memory system. Furthermore, WL-Reviver is a lightweight framework of very low overhead. Our extensive experiments show that WL-Reviver can efficiently revive a wear-leveling scheme without compromising the scheme's wear-leveling effect.","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.33","","","","","","International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and|Networks (DSN)","JUN 23-26, 2014","Atlanta, GA","IEEE, IFIP, IEEE Comp Soc","978-1-4799-2233-8","","IEEE","","","","","","5"

Attackers can recruit a large number of machines at economic intensive through spamming. Spain zombies are compromised machines in a network which are involved in the spamming activities. Spammers use spam zombies to perform cyber crimes. Spamming causes wastage of network bandwidth. So it is a significant challenge for system administrators to identify and block the spammers in a network. The existing spam zombie detections algorithms are PT(Percentage Threshold), CT(Count Threshold) and SPOT. This paper shows comparison of these spank zombie detection algorithms. The result shows that SPOT gives good result as compared to PT and CT. The proposed system assists system administrators to automatically detect the spammers in their networks in an online manner. For spammer detection the system uses a SPOT detection algorithm which is based on a statistical tool known as Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The experimental results shows that the SPOT detection algorithm detects the spammers very effectively. The system blocks the spammers and user can reactivate their account by passing a security test. The system also detects and deletes emails with virus files in the attachments. The proposed system focuses only on detection of spammers and not the prevention.","","","","","","","","Kishore, KVK|Kumar, KH|Venkatramaphanikumar, S","","1st International Conference on Networks & Soft Computing (ICNSC)","AUG 19-20, 2014","Guntur, INDIA","Vignans Fdn Sci Technol & Res Univ, IEEE Hyderabad Sect, IEEE Computat Intelligence Hyderabad Chapter, Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol, Sci & Engn Res Support Soc, Dept CSE","978-1-4799-3486-7","","","","","","","","2"

OTP-DEF provides authentication by using OTP-based tests, which is different from other systems that use graphical tests. First of all, according to the load of web server, an OTP-DEF web-server should fall into one of three following modes: normal, suspected attack or confirmed attack mode, and the OTP-DEF authentication mechanism shall only be activated when web-server is in suspected attack mode. Secondly, we use OTP as our puzzle, which can automatically change at the certain time interval. It makes our proposal can defend socially-engineered attack, copy attacks, replay attacks and Brute-Force Attack. Thirdly, OTP-DEF uses an intermediate stage to identify the FP addresses that ignore the test, and persistently bombard the server with requests despite repeated failures at solving the puzzles. These machines are zombies because their intent is to congest the server. Once these machines are identified, OTP-DEF blocks their requests, turns the tests off, and allows access to legitimate users who are unable or unwilling to solve tests. Finally, OTP-DEF requires no modifications to client software.","","","10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.480-481.769","","","","","Wu, YW","Key Engineering Materials","International Conference on Materials Engineering for Advanced|Technologies (ICMEAT2011)","MAY 05-06, 2011","Singapore, SINGAPORE","Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Pacific Human-Comp Interact Res Ctr","","","","","1 + 2","","","","3"

It is mobilized in discussions of power relations; the repressed part of the self or society; the 'other', and especially the other within; global capitalism; and the cognitive processes of contemporary human beings. We suggest that it is feasible to read the long-term and sustained attention paid to zombies in both academic and popular culture as a response to contemporary thought about what it means to be human because of three central characteristics that emerge consistently in zombie texts. First, they are always 'all dark inside', lacking ethical or affective judgements. Next, they are unrelentingly, unquenchably and indiscriminately hungry. Finally, they are simultaneously like and unlike humans: 'people without minds', who lack individual cognitive functioning and hence identity. As such, they are useful spaces in which to reflect on being human in contemporary society. To discuss these issues, we draw on a number of zombie novels and movies produced over recent decades, to explore the ways in which they allegorize the effects of the contemporary arrangements of Western societies, and the production of the body as trope.","","","10.1177/1357034XO8090699","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

We analyze the proposed scheme using discrete-time Markov chain analysis under varying e-mail traffic loads and service capacities. This paper also considers the effects of e-mail retransmission and illegal spam relaying by zombie systems on the performance of the proposed scheme. Results from our analysis show that e-mail server loading decreases by using the proposed technique. This allows the reduction in non-spam e-mail queuing delays and loss probability. Our scheme also protects e-mail servers from being overloaded by spam traffic and, if performed collectively over the Internet, it is capable of performing outbound spam control.

From these articles I analyze both the words used to describe Haiti and the emerging media frames. Critical studies have shown that representation in the media can greatly impact the conventional wisdom surrounding a place and legitimize social inequalities. By understanding the images used to describe Haiti, I hope to develop a means of rethinking popular perceptions of the country.

We also discuss the well-known Botnets engaged in the execution of a Peep attack. In our paper, we describe a Peep attack on the Internet as the paradigm of how a cyber-investigator needs to act in the case of a Cybercrime. When cyber detectives prepare to investigate a break in cyber security, there are some issues they must keep in mind and face up to. It is crucial to swiftly preserve digital evidence and conduct forensic analysis that any useful evidence is seized soon after the cybercrime has been committed. Furthermore, there are two phases of digital forensic analysis to retrieve useful evidence when facing a cybercrime attack in our scheme. One phase observes the Internet attack action, and the other one introduces how to investigate each case in on-line analysis of sniffing packets and off-line examination of abnormal files. We believe that this analysis model is workable for any other form of Botnets presently being used. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, researching this issue was hindered by the lack of readily available models. Immersive virtual worlds could represent a solution, by providing ways to test human behavior in controlled life-threatening situations. Using a massively multi-player zombie apocalypse setting, we analysed spontaneously reported feelings of guilt following ethically questionable actions related to survival. The occurrence and magnitude of guilt depended on the nature of the consequences of the action. Furthermore, feelings of guilt predicted long-lasting changes in behavior, displayed as compensatory actions. Finally, actions inflicting immediate harm to others appeared mostly prompted by panic and were more commonly regretted. Thus, extreme conditions trigger a reduction of the impact of ethical norms in decision making, although awareness of ethicality is retained to a surprising extent.","","25007261","10.1371/journal.pone.0101711","","","","e101711","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two-month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only 7 internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT.","","","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062096","","","","","","IEEE INFOCOM","IEEE INFOCOM Conference 2009","APR 19-25, 2009","Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL","IEEE","978-1-4244-3512-8","","IEEE","","","","","","6"

Apart from this sociocritical tradition, the TV show The Walking Dead introduces a further level of reflection. Even though many aesthetic and narrative traditions of the zombie genre are taken up, the serial nature of the show allows a deeper view of the characters in the face of apocalyptic disintegration of personal, familial and social certainties, and normative structures. This uncertainty is most clearly illustrated in the dealing with death. Arguments The Walking Dead also reflects the increasing real dissolution of the certainty of death by the life sciences since the 1960s. In The Walking Dead, the characteristics and consequences of this discourse are sharpened dramatically in the form of a negation of biological certainties.

Such attacks are carried out by a ""bot-net"", an army of zombie hosts spread around the Internet, that overwhelm the bandwidth toward their victim Web server, by sending traffic upon command. This paper introduces WDA, a novel architecture to attenuate the DDoS attacker's bandwidth. WDA is especially designed to protect Web farms. WDA is asymmetric and only monitors and protects the uplink toward the Web farm, which is the typical bottleneck in DDoS attacks. Legitimate traffic toward Web farms is very distinctive since it is produced by humans using Web-browsing software. Specifically, such upload traffic has low volume, and more importantly, has long off times that correspond to human view time. WDA utilizes these properties of legitimate client traffic to distinguish it from attack traffic, which tends to be continuous and heavy. A key feature of WDA is in its use of randomized thresholds that trap and penalize deterministic zombie traffic that tries to mimic human client patterns. WDA's heart is WDAQ a novel active queue management mechanism aimed to prefer legitimate client traffic over attacker traffic. With WDA installed, the attacker traffic toward the victim is attenuated. Extensive simulation results show that WDA can defeat simple flooding attacks, and can attenuate the bandwidth usable by sophisticated WDA-aware attacks by orders of magnitude. As a consequence, the attacker must increase his ""bot-net"" size by the same factor, to compensate for the effects of WDA. Our simulations show that WDA can defend a typical Web farm from DDoS attacks launched by hundreds of thousands zombies, while keeping legitimate clients' service degradation under 10%.

Though both the zombie and the saint defy the border between life and death, this article describes the way that each operates in a dialectical capacity concerning metaphors of colonisation and contamination. The zombie is simultaneously a figure for the slave (as we can trace its origins to Haiti) and slave rebellion: its morbid immortality connotes rebellion, and defiance. The zombie is at once a feeble corpse and yet, it nonetheless wields a subversive power. The martyred saints investigated here, St Denis and St Edmund the King, are each, simultaneously, stand-ins for the subjugated and the sovereign, the sick as well as the cured. These metaphoric categories overlap, informing and shaping each other. In the tales of the Christian martyrs, this works to represent conversion as capable of spreading like disease, of faith as a spiritual colonisation.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The Buddha taught that the illusion of self-ish-ness, and resulting attachments, are the greatest hurdles to achieving nibbana. Through meditating on the decomposing corpse, Buddhists may come to realize the Ten Impurities of the Body, and so come to grips with the impermanence of the self. I will illustrate how George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, recognized as the watershed film of the modern zombie sub-genre, unintentionally conveys the Buddhist teachings of dukkha (suffering by attachments), anatta (no-self), and anicca (impermanence).","","","10.1080/14639940802556461","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

I argue that this is wrong and that the diet notion of qualia has no distinctive content. There is no phenomenal residue left when qualia are stripped of their intrinsicality, ineffability, and subjectivity. Thus, if we reject classic qualia realism, we should accept that all that needs explaining are 'zero' qualia - our dispositions to judge that our experiences have classic qualia.

In particular, we determine the disk regions where the MRI can be shut off either by Ohmic resistivity (the so-called dead and undead zones) or by ambipolar diffusion (a region we term the zombie zone). We consider two stellar masses: M-* = 0.7M(circle dot) and 0.1M(circle dot). In each case, we assume that: the disk surface density profile is that of a scaled Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, with M-disk/M-* = 0.01 as suggested by current data; disk ionization is driven primarily by stellar X-rays, complemented by cosmic rays and radionuclides; and the stellar X-ray luminosity scales with bolometric luminosity as L-X/L-* approximate to 10(-3.5), as observed. Ionization rates are calculated with the moccasin Monte Carlo X-ray transport code, and ionization balance determined using a simplified chemical network, including well-mixed 0.1 mu m grains at various levels of depletion. We find that (1) ambipolar diffusion is the primary factor controlling MRI activity in disks around both solar-type and very low mass classical T Tauri stars. Assuming that the MRI yields the maximum possible field strength at each radius, we further find that: (2) the MRI-active layer constitutes only similar to 5%-10% of the total disk mass; (3) the accretion rate (M.) varies radially in both magnitude and sign (inward or outward), implying time-variable accretion as well as the creation of disk gaps and overdensities, with consequences for planet formation and migration; (4) achieving the empirical accretion rates in solar-type and very low mass stars requires a depletion of well-mixed small grains (via grain growth and/or settling) by a factor of 10-1000 relative to the standard dust-to-gas mass ratio of 10(-2); and (5) the current non-detection of polarized emission from field-aligned grains in the outer disk regions is consistent with active MRI at those radii.","","","10.1088/0004-637X/764/1/65","","Turner, Neal/0000-0001-8292-1943","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

To address this challenge, we present a very basic framework which we call Zombie Survival Optimization (ZSO), a novel swarm intelligence approach modeled after the foraging behavior of zombies. Zombies (exploration agents) search in a space where the underlying fitness is modeled as a hypothetical airborne antidote which cures a zombie's aliments and turns them back into humans (who attempt to survive by exploiting the search space). Such an optimization algorithm is useful for search, such as searching an image for a pedestrian. Experiments on the CAVIAR dataset suggest improved efficiency over Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO).

Thus, this kind of mobile malware presents a significant threat to Homeland Security. This is possible because smartphones can serve as zombie devices which are then controlled by hackers' via a C&C server. In this paper, we discuss the defining characteristics inherent in mobile malware and show mobile attack scenarios which are feasible against Homeland Security. We also propose a static analysis tool, DroidAnalyzer, which identifies potential vulnerabilities of Android apps and the presence of root exploits.

Especially recent research has divulged that an adversary equipped with little more than a cable modem can block all voice communication in a metropolitan area or even in entire country of the size of USA by sending enormous short message service (SMS) traffic via Internet. To overcome this threat in particular and other client-server communication problems in general, a new secure protocol, Call-Back Authentication (CBA), for web to phone SMS communication is proposed. The protocol introduces two-tier server architecture and pulls data traffic control (PDTC) mechanism for secure communication. The protocol is aimed to throat-knot malicious traffic at GSM-Internet interface gateway. The results show that the CBA protocol secures all GSM services from Internet originated SMS floods. Moreover the authentication mechanism of the CBA protocol identifies and blocks the spoofed as well as the zombie requests. The CBA server requires lesser resources to deliver SMS as compared to existing mechanism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, their impact on PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and little is known about what makes a good mHealth app.|Objective: The aim was to determine the effects of two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels.|Methods: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14-17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8-week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed design and narrative. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1-mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps.|Results: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n=17), nonimmersive app intervention (n=16), or the control group (n=18). The mean age of participants was 15.7 (SD 1.2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61%, 31/51) and 57% (29/51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96% (49/51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was -28.4 seconds shorter (95% CI -66.5 to 9.82, P=.20) for the immersive app group and -24.7 seconds (95% CI -63.5 to 14.2, P=.32) for the nonimmersive app group. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes.|Conclusions: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity.","","26316499","10.2196/jmir.4568","","","","e210","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4"

Deadlands was followed by Death of a Saint (2012) and Army of the Left (2013). The novels are set ten years after the zombie apocalypse, referred to as the War' by the characters, which took place during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Tournament in South Africa. The novels should be read within the context of a resurgence of zombie fiction in the USA and Europe after 2000. Described by Lauren Beukes as teen-fighting-zombie-fun', Herne's novels have all the makings of zombie fiction in global popular culture. In Herne's depiction of a South African zombie apocalypse, though, the zombies - except for the threat of contagion - are not the real enemy. They are pawns in a power struggle between the human survivors of the apocalypse and the Guardians, mysterious figures who seem to have appeared out of nowhere after the apocalypse. The way in which politics, power and witchcraft are intertwined in Herne's novels can therefore also be linked to the zombie discourse in postcolonial South Africa. Here, I explore whether Herne expresses a specific view in her novels on the role of authority in contemporary society.","1943-8117","","10.1080/00138398.2015.1045163","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

(2012). Acting as a combination of a mobile phone fitness application and radio play, Zombies Run! encourages the player to find a new reason to exercise, by aurally layering a zombie apocalypse over the real world. Beginning with a review of the evolutionary paradoxes that make running largely a biologically inefficient act for humans, the author explores the contentious figure of the running zombie (Zombie 2.0) and how it complicates humanity's ability to 'other' itself from the undead. Zombies Run! creates a space between fact and fiction that facilitates a mythogeographic perception of place and instances of paraludism. Here, the player is able to accept the rules of the fictional play world and the act of running lessens the ability to objectify the undead. To outrun the Zombie 2.0, humanity invariably runs towards the very thing they are fleeing from.","2040-0616","","10.1080/14682761.2014.967020","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

P-zombies are intimately linked to the hard problem of consciousness and have been invoked as arguments against physicalist approaches. But what if we were to invert the characteristics of p-zombies? Such an inverse (i-) zombie would possess all of the behavioral features and responses of an insensate being, yet would nonetheless be conscious.|While p-zombies are logically possible but naturally improbable, an approximation of i-zombies actually exists: individuals experiencing what is referred to as ""anesthesia awareness."" Patients under general anesthesia may be intubated (preventing speech), paralyzed (preventing movement), and narcotized (minimizing response to nociceptive stimuli). Thus, they appear-and typically are-unconscious. In 1-2 cases/1000, however, patients may be aware of intraoperative events, sometimes without any objective indices. Furthermore, a much higher percentage of patients (22% in a recent Study) may have the subjective experience of dreaming during general anesthesia.|P-zombies confront us with the hard problem of consciousness-how do we explain the presence of qualia? I-zombies present a more practical problem-how do we detect the presence of qualia? The current investigation compares p-zombies to i-zombies and explores the ""hard problem"" of unconsciousness with a focus on anesthesia awareness. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It does this by positing that whether phenomenal concepts refer to physical or nonphysical states depends on what the actual world is like. In this paper, I offer support for the Chalmers/Alter objection that the conditional analysis fails to accommodate the true zombie intuition, and develop a new and far more powerful argument against the conditional analysis. I argue that, as stated, the conditional analysis is radically incomplete. But when fully fleshed out, the analysis becomes viciously circular. The only way to avoid this circularity is to adopt a species of analytic functionalism, on which it's a priori that phenomenal concepts refer to the state (perhaps physical, perhaps nonphysical) that actually plays so-and-so functional role. While this rigidified analytic functionalism is coherent, it is highly unattractive, running contrary to both the intuitions that motivate functionalism and the intuitions that motivated the conditional analysis.","","","10.1007/s11098-012-9958-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Drawing on historiographic and ethnographic data from isiXhosa, one of South Africa's indigenous languages, this paper reflects on both of these concepts. Standardization is discussed as a modernist grand narrative whose continued application to linguistic thinking has outlived its usefulness, and standard languages as such (hegemonoc, prescriptive, etc.) might be assigned to Beck's (2002) zombie categories of modernity. Discussing the example of brandy-talk in isiXhosa from the perspective of ethnographic lexicography (Silverstein 2006), the paper argues for a linguistic perspective which focuses on the articulation and reproduction of social meaning as a central mechanism in the formation of linguistic conventions or ways of speaking. It advocates a recognition of the practices of speakers as they draw on standard and non-standard forms, as well as their associated meanings and ideologies (first/second order indexicality), in positioning themselves as social beings with identities, histories, aspirations, and ideological stances in everyday talk.","","","10.1515/mult.2010.012","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

The first makes one think of perfection, of happiness, of something new and better; the other, of the monstrous, of death and decay. Despite the fact that these images are arguably the most common, one can question their validity: can it be said that utopias are always perfect, and are the undead always monstrous? In this paper, I aim to explore the concepts relating to both utopias and zombies and the possible connections between the two, including a reading of the undead in light of the ultimate utopia: Paradise. In the light of these analyses, I propose a more positive approach to the figure of the zombie, which will be discussed as a counterpoint to the commonly held views of (religious) utopias.","","","10.15291/SIC/2.5.LC.6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

These tasks include stealing sensitive user information. Detection of bots using solutions such as behavioral correlation of flow records, group activity in DNS traffic, observing the periodic repeatability in communication, etc., lead to monitoring the network traffic and then classifying them as Bot or normal traffic. Other solutions for Bot detection include kernel level key stroke verification, system call initialization, IP black listing, etc. In the first two solutions there is no assurance that the packet carrying user information is prevented from being sent to the attacker and the latter suffers from the problem of IP spoofing. This motivated us to think of a solution that would filter out the malicious packets before being put onto the network. To come out with such a solution, a real time bot attack was generated with Spy Eye Exploit kit and traffic characteristics were analyzed. The analysis revealed the existence of a unique repeated communication between the Zombie machine and the botmaster. This motivated us to propose, a Pattern Programmable Kernel Filter (PPKF) for filtering out the malicious packets generated by bots. PPKF was developed using the windows filtering platform (WFP) filter engine. PPKF was programmed to filter out the packets with unique pattern which were observed from the bot attack experiments. Further PPKF was found to completely suppress the flow of packets having the programmed uniqueness in them thus preventing the functioning of bots in terms of user information being sent to the Botmaster.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3"

These mutants identify a group of loci making up about 20% of the loci identified by mutants with visible morphological phenotypes within the first day of development. There are 12 Class I mutants, which fall into 5 complementation groups and have cells that lyse before morphological defects are observed. Mutants at three loci, speed bump, ogre and zombie, display abnormal nuclei. The 8 Class II mutants, which fall into 6 complementation groups, arrest development before cell lysis is observed. These mutants seemingly stop development in the late segmentation stages, and maintain a body shape similar to a 20 hour embryo.|Mutations in speed bump, ogre, zombie, specter, poltergeist and troll were tested for cell lethality by transplanting mutant cells into wild-type hosts. With poltergeist, transplanted mutant cells all survive. The remainder of the mutants tested were autonomously but conditionally lethal: mutant cells, most of which lyse, sometimes survive to become notochord, muscles, or, in rare cases, large neurons, all cell types which become postmitotic in the gastrula. Some of the genes of the early arrest group may be necessary for progression though the cell cycle; if so, the survival of early differentiating cells may be based on having their terminal mitosis before the zygotic requirement for these genes.","","9007229","","Kelsh, Robert/B-6445-2008; Van Eeden, Freek/E-6198-2010; Brand,|Michael/A-5509-2010; Jiang, Yun-Jin/E-3995-2010","Kelsh, Robert/0000-0002-9381-0066; Jiang, Yun-Jin/0000-0003-0499-7306","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1|5"

Firstly, persons process information at a 'super'-Turing level; secondly, people enjoy certain properties (e.g. intentionality) beyond the reach of any mere information-processing object. Accordingly, computationalism ought to be supplanted with the engineering of 'subperson' artifacts and the irreducibly philosophical investigation of personhood.

Melancholia is linked to the movement of the drive dimension, while depression is linked to psychic conflict. In both, the Ego is involved.

At the centre of many of these attacks is a large pool of compromised computers located in homes, schools, businesses, and governments around the world. Attackers use these zombies as anonymous proxies to hide their real identities and amplify their attacks. Bot software enables an operator to remotely control each system and group them together to form what is commonly referred to as a zombie army or botnet. A botnet is a network of compromised machines that can he remotely controlled by an attacker.

This paper explains how this situation came about in the light of the evolution of economics more generally, and explores how development economics has become Americanised, more influential within development studies, policy- rather than critically oriented, and subject to an agenda increasingly set by the World Bank. It concludes by pointing to the challenges and the opportunities open to development studies as neoliberalism experiences a profound crisis to which the new development economics can only offer partial and piecemeal responses.","1360-2241","","10.1080/01436590902959073","","","","PII 912276578","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Specifically, we develop semantics and type systems for the constructs of the Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME) programming model; our results apply also to other constructs, such as atomic blocks. With this semantics as a point of reference, we study several implementation strategies. We model STM systems that use in-place update, optimistic concurrency, lazy conflict detection, and roll-back. These strategies are correct only under non-trivial assumptions that we identify and analyze. One important source of errors is that some efficient implementations create dangerous ""zombie"" computations where a transaction keeps running after experiencing a conflict; the assumptions confine the effects of these computations.","","","10.1145/1328438.1328449","","","","","","","35th ACM-SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages","JAN 07-12, 2008","San Francisco, CA","ACM SIGPLAN, ACM SIGACT","978-1-59593-689-9","","ACM","","","","","","4"

I argue for this by examining two attempts to account for belief without reference to phenomenal consciousness, functionalism and Dennett's patterns of behavior theory, and showing that they both fail.

It attempts to show that the popular zombie argument, mostly due to David Chalmers, is reminescent of this Cartesian proof of dualism. The intended conclusion is that although the contemporary argument invokes modal semantic analysis and two-dimensional theory of conceptual content and so is technically more difficult and resistant to certain physicalist criticism, it neverhteless rests on an unstated and unjustified assumption. This assumption is that of epistemic transparency and completeness of at least some of our concepts. It was the same assumption that had been identified as one of the weaknesses of the original Cartesian argument for dualism. Therefore, one could argue that Arnauld's objections to Descartes are well applicable to Chalmers' antiphysicalist arguments without substantial modification.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Recent literature from the former GDR has been characterised by a fascination with death but also with spectrality; the revenant undead in the form of ghosts, spectres, vampires, and zombies. A notable example is the revival of the medieval 'danse macabre' in a series of contemporary 'Neue Totentanze' (2002). This preoccupation links with those recent poetological programmes that have focused on the archaeological excavation of memory, but also with the interest in time which has been noted by a number of observers. However, there is more at stake: an ironic take on Marx and the loss of ideals, a concern with work, an exploration of literature as 'postscript', and a fascination with epochal lateness which chimes with contemporary international interests. This paper will focus on lyric and prose texts by Volker Braun - Tumulus (1999), Auf die schonen Possen (2005) and Machwerk oder das Schichtbuch des Flick von Lauchhammer (2008) - to explore how the 'last words' of the GDR offer a political and aesthetic rejoinder to a depleted contemporary reality.","","","","","","","","","","Conference of the University-Teachers-of-German","APR, 2009","Univ Ulster, Belfast, NORTH IRELAND","Univ Teachers German","","Univ Ulster","","","","","","","1"

Common critical and popular analyses of zombie films focus on the body of the zombie, but pay little attention to surrounding spaces. Zombie films of the past ten years are increasingly being set in cities, a trend that I argue allows for the transfer of the ambiguous identity of zombie bodies to city spaces. The zombie outbreak creates an 'other'-space that I term blank space in which previously rigidly codified spaces are subject to new constructions that reinscribe bodies with new, and potentially 'other', subjectivities. Through an analysis of six zombie films (Night of the Living Dead, Land of the Dead, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, 28 Days Later, and 28 Weeks Later), I argue that for geographers, zombie films can be read as expressions of a bodies-cities theory that emphasizes the role that spatial and bodily otherness plays in the constitution of bodies and cities. For bodies-cities theory, zombies offer a manifestation of the mutuality between bodies and cities that foregrounds corporeality while articulating the importance of difference and otherness for the constitution of bodies and cities.","","","10.1080/14649361003637166","","","","PII 919913841","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Fittingly labeled 'type-Z' (for zombie), this reply essentially grants to the zombie lover not just the possibility of zombies, but also their actuality. We turn out to be the very creatures Chalmers has taken such great pains to conceive and more conventional materialists have tried to wipe off the face of the planet. So consciousness (at least for us) is a wholly material affair What is conceivable but non-actual are not zombies, but rather 'angelic' beings possessing an acquaintance with supermaterial phenomenal states. After showing how Chalmers' recent discussion of the phenomenal concepts strategy should incline those pursuing such a strategy toward a type-Z response, this paper relates type-Z materialism to similar replies that Chalmers has found 'hard to classify' and closes with a brief remark about how a type-Z materialist might reply to the knowledge argument.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

Ethnographic and historical evidence reveals that they compromise and cooperate with the lowland state more often than they oppose it. Although hill peoples are commonly conceived as 'barbarians' of the periphery, and ill-treated or instrumentalized accordingly, in some circumstances they played a central role in the defence and the reshaping of pre-modern and modern Southeast Asian states. Moreover, their political and religious acculturation by lowland societies sometimes proves to have been instrumental in the perpetuation of a specific identity under the guise of surface assimilation. This article not only highlights the dynamics of past and present interactions between lowland and upland societies but also questions the future of the latter, in the context of an increasing engulfment by nation-states and, conversely, of new perspectives offered by globalization. The analysis thus demonstrates that hill peoples often take advantage of new forms of partnership resulting from globalization to renegotiate their image and status more favourably, and to counter the pressure exerted by the dominant society. Finally, they appear to be neither Zomian - that is, uncompromising rebels to 'stateness' in James C. Scott's formulation - nor zombies, unable to adapt.","","","10.1017/S1740022810000100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1"

In these attacks, an adversary does not saturate the bandwidth of the victim server through inbound traffic, but through outbound traffic. The next aim of the adversary is to consume and exhaust computational resources (e.g., CPU cycles), memory resources, TCP/IP stack, resources of input/output devices, etc. This paper proposes a novel scheme which is called ConnectionScore to resist such DDoS attacks. During the attack time, any connection is scored based on history and statistical analysis which has been done during the normal condition. The bottleneck resources are retaken from those connections which take lower scores. Our analysis shows that connections established by the adversary give low scores. In fact, the ConnectionScore technique can estimate legitimacy of connections with high probability. The rate of suspicious connections being dropped is adjusted based on the current level of overload of the server and a threshold-level of free resources.

Our volatility measure also indicates the evolution of firm turnover. We find that patterns in firm-specific volatility have changed when macroeconomic circumstances have. Firm turnover declined during the economic stagnation of 1991-1997. The deep downturn of fiscal years 1998-2002 coincided with a substantial increase in turnover in market, profit and employment shares. Firm volatility tended to decline during the recovery after 2002. We assess whether the rise in firm turnover and deep downturn in 1998-2002 indicate that after a period of stagnation, weak firms were finally allowed to shrink or fail. Our evidence suggests that the widening in the firm growth distribution at that time did not reflect weak firms shrinking relative to healthy firms, indicating that the two recessions in 1998-2002 were not ""cleansing"".

This paper studies the information diffusion in Sina microblog and proposes a novel measurement of the activation probabilities based on Independent Cascade Model. The activation probabilities measure considers tweets, relationships, and users, so it is called TRU (Tweets, Relationships, and Users) measurement. We randomly select more than 3 million tweets to analyze and find that multimedia plays a very important role in information diffusion. The relationships contain not only the similarity of interests, but also behavioral momentum between two users. The users mainly consider a user's influence in the microblog network and we apply a PageRank-like algorithm to measure it. The TRU measurement has dynamic and heterogeneous nature. It is evaluated in a network with millions of users collected from Sina microblog. And the zombie fans whose followers or tweets are less than five have been cleared away. In the experiment, we do not take the parameters in the formula of activation probabilities for granted, but try different values time after time using different tweets to find out the best values. The result shows that TRU measurement can describe the actual information diffusion in microblog very well.","","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Information Society (I-Society)","JUN 24-26, 2013","Toronto, CANADA","","978-1-908320-13-1","","IEEE","","","","","","4"

I argue that philosophers must learn to appreciate better the effects of physical scales. Specifically, thought experiments in philosophy should be more sensitive to physical scale effects, because the conclusion of a thought experiment may be undermined by unintentionally ignored scale effects, and the changes required to obtain the foreground state of affairs in a thought experiment might require unacknowledged scale-spanning changes to the contextual background. I discuss four philosophical thought experiments: Putnam's Twin Earth and Brain in a Vat, Searle's Chinese Room, and Chalmers's Zombies Without Qualia.

In this study, we developed a method of monitoring behaviors of host-based processes from the point that a bot header attempts to make zombie PCs, detecting cyber attack precursor symptoms. We designed an algorithm that figures out characteristics of botnet which attempts to launch malicious behaviors by means of signature registration, which is for process/reputation/network traffic/packet/source analysis and a white list, as a measure to respond to bots from the end point.","","","","","","","","Kim, TH|Vasilakos, T|Sakurai, K|Xiao, Y|Zhao, G|Slezak, D","Communications in Computer and Information Science","International Conference on Future Generation Communication and|Networking","DEC 13-15, 2010","Jeju Island, SOUTH KOREA","","978-3-642-17603-6","","","","2","","","","5"

This is a variation of the tonic-phasic' hypothesis, which takes D1 allelic variation into account.","1440-1665","24425798","10.1177/1039856213517948","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2"

Validation measurements of the activity of a Ni-63 source against the Triple to Double Coincidence Ratio method are presented and the results agree within their standard uncertainties.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2013.2275990","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","","","","4"

Criminals with large networks (botnets) of compromised nodes (zombies) use the threat of DoS attacks to extort legitimate companies. To fight these threats and ensure network reliability, early detection of these attacks is critical. Many methods have been developed with limited success to date. This paper presents an approach that identifies change points in the time series of network packet arrival rates. The proposed process has two stages: (i) statistical analysis that finds the rate of increase of network traffic, and (ii) wavelet analysis of the network statistics that quickly detects the sudden increases in packet arrival rates characteristic of botnet attacks. Most intrusion detections are tested using data sets from special security testing configurations, which leads to unacceptable false positive rates being found when they are used in the real world. We test our approach using data from both network simulations and a large operational network. The true and false positive detection rates are determined for both data sets, and receiver operating curves use these rates to find optimal parameters for our approach. Evaluation using operational data proves the effectiveness of our approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

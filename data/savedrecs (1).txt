TI Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in Japan
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Large Japanese banks often engaged in sham loan restructurings that kept credit flowing to otherwise insolvent borrowers (which we call zombies). We examine the implications of suppressing the normal competitive process whereby the zombies would shed workers and lose market share. The congestion created by the zombies reduces the profits for healthy firms, which discourages their entry and investment. We confirm that zombie-dominated industries exhibit more depressed job creation and destruction, and lower productivity. We present firm-level regressions showing that the increase in zombies depressed the investment and employment growth of non-zombies and widened the productivity gap between zombies and non-zombies.

TI Inverse zombies, anesthesia awareness, and the hard problem of
   unconsciousness
SO CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
AB Philosophical (p-) zombies are constructs that possess all of the behavioral features and responses of a sentient human being, yet are not conscious. P-zombies are intimately linked to the hard problem of consciousness and have been invoked as arguments against physicalist approaches. But what if we were to invert the characteristics of p-zombies? Such an inverse (i-) zombie would possess all of the behavioral features and responses of an insensate being, yet would nonetheless be conscious.
   While p-zombies are logically possible but naturally improbable, an approximation of i-zombies actually exists: individuals experiencing what is referred to as "anesthesia awareness." Patients under general anesthesia may be intubated (preventing speech), paralyzed (preventing movement), and narcotized (minimizing response to nociceptive stimuli). Thus, they appear-and typically are-unconscious. In 1-2 cases/1000, however, patients may be aware of intraoperative events, sometimes without any objective indices. Furthermore, a much higher percentage of patients (22% in a recent Study) may have the subjective experience of dreaming during general anesthesia.
   P-zombies confront us with the hard problem of consciousness-how do we explain the presence of qualia? I-zombies present a more practical problem-how do we detect the presence of qualia? The current investigation compares p-zombies to i-zombies and explores the "hard problem" of unconsciousness with a focus on anesthesia awareness. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Signs of meta-change in second modernity: the growth of e-sport and the

SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB Media, communication and information flows now define the logic and structure of social relations, a situation that affects almost every dimension of cultural life and activity. This article analyses the transformation of the relationship between computer gaming, media and sport in the global age of 'second modernity'. This analysis is undertaken through a critical case study of the World Cyber Games (WCG). This popular event and the 'cyber-athletes' that compete in it cannot be explained fully by reference to existing studies of computer and video gaming, media and sport, media events or organized sporting competition. It is not possible to think in terms of sport and the media when considering the WCG and organized competitive gaming. This is sport as media or e-sport, a term that signifies the seamless interpenetration of media content, sport and networked information and communications technologies.

TI Zombie science: A sinister consequence of evaluating scientific theories
   purely on the basis of enlightened self-interest
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Although the classical ideal is that scientific theories are evaluated by a careful teasing-out of their internal logic and external implications, and checking whether these deductions and predictions are in-line-with old and new observations; the fact that so many vague, dumb or incoherent scientific theories are apparently believed by so many scientists for so many years is suggestive that this ideal. does not necessarily reflect real world practice. In the real world it looks more like most scientists are quite willing to pursue wrong ideas for so tong as they are rewarded with a better chance of achieving more grants, publications and status. The classic account has it that bogus theories should readily be demolished by sceptical (or jealous) competitor scientists. However, in practice even the most conclusive 'hatchet jobs' may fail to kill, or even weaken, phoney hypotheses when they are backed-up with sufficient economic muscle in the form of lavish and sustained funding. And when a branch of science based on phoney theories serves a useful but non-scientific purpose, it may be kept-going indefinitely by continuous transfusions of cash from those whose interests it serves. If this happens, real science expires and a 'zombie science' evolves. Zombie science is science that is dead but will not lie down. It keeps twitching and lumbering around so that (from a distance, and with your eyes half-closed) zombie science looks much like the real thing. But in fact the zombie has no life of its own; it is animated and moved only by the incessant pumping of funds. If zombie science is not scientificalty-useable - what is its function? In a nutshell, zombie science is supported because it is useful propaganda to be deployed in arenas such as political rhetoric, public administration, management, public relations, marketing and the mass media generally. It persuades, it constructs taboos, it buttresses some kind of rhetorical attempt to shape mass opinion. Indeed, zombie science often comes across in the mass media as being more plausible than real science; and it is precisely the superficial face-plausibility which is the sole and sufficient purpose of zombie science.

TI Taking type-b materialism seriously
SO MIND & LANGUAGE
AB Type-B materialism is the thesis that though phenomenal states are necessarily identical with physical states, phenomenal concepts have no a priori connections to physical or functional concepts. Though type-B materialists have invoked this conceptual independence to counter a number of well-known arguments against physicalism (e.g. the conceivability of zombies, the ignorance of Mary, the existence of an 'explanatory gap'), anti-physicalists have raised objections to this strategy. My aim here is to defend type-B materialism against these objections, by arguing that they share the common problem of not taking the central features of the view sufficiently seriously. However, I will end by noting that type-B materialism raises other questions, and suggesting that what stands in the way of an adequate naturalistic account of phenomenal states may be the propensity to take type-B materialism more seriously than it deserves.

TI Some kind of virus: The zombie as body and as trope
SO BODY & SOCIETY
AB The idea of zombie emerges in a surprising number of disciplines, beyond Holly-wood film or the sci-fi novel. It is mobilized in discussions of power relations; the repressed part of the self or society; the 'other', and especially the other within; global capitalism; and the cognitive processes of contemporary human beings. We suggest that it is feasible to read the long-term and sustained attention paid to zombies in both academic and popular culture as a response to contemporary thought about what it means to be human because of three central characteristics that emerge consistently in zombie texts. First, they are always 'all dark inside', lacking ethical or affective judgements. Next, they are unrelentingly, unquenchably and indiscriminately hungry. Finally, they are simultaneously like and unlike humans: 'people without minds', who lack individual cognitive functioning and hence identity. As such, they are useful spaces in which to reflect on being human in contemporary society. To discuss these issues, we draw on a number of zombie novels and movies produced over recent decades, to explore the ways in which they allegorize the effects of the contemporary arrangements of Western societies, and the production of the body as trope.

TI Gauge blocks - A Zombie technology
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND
   TECHNOLOGY
AB Gauge blocks have been the primary method for disseminating length traceability for over 100 years. Their longevity was based on two things: the relatively low cost of delivering very high accuracy to users, and the technical limitation that the range of high precision gauging systems was very small. While the first reason is still true, the second factor is being displaced by changes in measurement technology since the 1980s. New long range sensors do not require master gauges that are nearly the same length as the part being inspected, and thus one of the primary attributes of gauge blocks, wringing stacks to match the part, is 110 longer needed. Relaxing the requirement that gauges wring presents an opportunity to develop new types of end standards that would increase the accuracy and usefulness of gauging systems.

TI The inconceivability of zombies
SO PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB If zombies were conceivable in the sense relevant to the 'conceivability argument' against physicalism, a certain epiphenomenalistic conception of consciousness-the 'e-qualia story'-would also be conceivable. But (it is argued) the e-qualia story is not conceivable because it involves a contradiction. The non-physical 'e-qualia' supposedly involved could not perform cognitive processing, which would therefore have to be performed by physical processes; and these could not put anyone into 'epistemic contact' with e-qualia, contrary to the e-qualia story. Interactionism does not enable zombists to escape these conclusions.

AB A recent strategy for defending physicalism about the mind against the zombie argument relies on the so-called conditional analysis of phenomenal concepts. According to this analysis, what kinds of states our phenomenal concepts refer to depends crucially on whether the actual world is merely physical or not. John Hawthorne, David Braddon-Mitchell and Robert Stalnaker have claimed, independently, that this analysis explains the conceivability of zombies in a way consistent with physicalism, thus blocking the zombie argument. Torin Alter has recently presented three arguments against the conditional analysis strategy. This paper defends the conditional analysis strategy against Alter's objections.

TI Cladistic analysis of Echinodorus (Alismataceae): simultaneous analysis
   of molecular and morphological data
SO CLADISTICS
AB Echinodorus is the second largest genus in the aquatic plant family Alismataceae. The genus is naturally distributed in the New World, but many species are known world-wide as popular aquarium plants. The views upon species delimitation and infrageneric classification of the genus have been controversial. Phenotypic plasticity of aquatic plants combined with reduced and presumably convergent morphological structures pose serious problems to classification, emphasizing the need for molecular-level data. A simultaneous cladistic analysis of molecular and morphological data was conducted to resolve the phylogeny of the genus. The results showed Echinodorus (as it is currently circumscribed) to be polyphyletic. None of the currently proposed infrageneric classifications of the genus were supported in the light of phylogenetic evidence. Also, many species and subspecies level rankings were found to be unnatural. Monophyly of Echinodorus is ascertained by separating Helanthium and the monotypic genus Albidella from Echinodorus. As a result, two new combinations (Helanthium bolivianum and H. zombiense) are made, and a detailed description of the genus Helanthium is provided. (c) The Willi Hennig Society 2007.

TI InfOrmation theory based detection against network behavior mimicking
   DDoS attacks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB DDoS is a spy-on-spy game between attackers and detectors. Attackers are mimicking network traffic patterns to disable the detection algorithms which are based on these features. It is an open problem of discriminating the mimicking DDoS attacks from massive legitimate network accessing. We observed that the zombies use controlled function(s) to pump attack packages to the victim, therefore, the attack flows to the victim are always share some properties, e.g. packages distribution behaviors, which are not possessed by legitimate flows in a short time period. Based on this observation, once there appear suspicious flows to a server, we start to calculate the distance of the package distribution behavior among the suspicious flows. If the distance is less than a given threshold, then it is a DDoS attack, otherwise, it is a legitimate accessing. Our analysis and the preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed method can discriminate mimicking flooding attacks from legitimate accessing efficiently and effectively.

TI Emerging concepts of how beta-amyloid proteins and pro-inflammatory
   cytokines might collaborate to produce an 'Alzheimer brain' (Review)
SO MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB Three steps lead to the development of full-blown sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease or dementia (AD). In the young brain, amyloid beta-(1-42) (A beta 42) is a normal aggregation-prone protein product of neuronal activity that is kept at a safe low level by proteolysis in neurons and glial cells, and by expulsion across the blood-brain barrier. But clearance declines with advancing age. Step 1: Because of the normal decline with age of the A beta 42-clearing mechanisms, toxic amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) made of dodecamers of the aggregation-prone A beta 42 start accumulating. These A beta 42 dodecamers selectively target the initially huge numbers of excitatory synapses of neurons and cause them to start slowly dropping, which increasingly impairs plasticity and sooner or later starts noticeably affecting memory formation. At a certain point, this increasing loss of synapses induces the neurons to redirect their still-expressed cell cycle proteins from post-mitotic jobs, such as maintaining synapses, to starting a cell cycle and partially or completely replicating DNA without entering mitosis. The resulting aneuploid or tetraploid neurons survive for as long as 6-12 months as quasi-functional 'undead zombies', with developing tangles of hyperphosphorylated T protein disrupting the vital anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria and other synapse-vital components. Step 2: The hallmark AD plaques appear as A beta 42 clearance continues to decline and the formation of A beta 42 non-diffusible fibrils be-ins in the aging brain. Step 3: A terminal cytokine-driven maelstrom begins in the aging brain when micro-glia, the brain's professional macrophages, are activated in and around the plaques. They produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. One of these, IFN-gamma, causes the astrocytes enwrapping the neuronal synapses to express their beta-secretase (BACE1) genes and produce and release A beta 42, which can kill the closely apposed neurons by binding to their p75(NTR) receptors, which generate apoptogenic signals. Astrocytes are also stimulated by the same cytokines to turn oil their nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 genes and start pouring large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and its cytocidal derivative peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) directly Out onto the closely apposed neurons.

AB Ensuring the security of computers is a non-trivial task, with many techniques used by malicious users to compromise these systems. In recent years a new threat has emerged in the form of networks of hijacked zombie machines used to perform complex distributed attacks such as denial of service and to obtain sensitive data such as password information. These zombie machines are said to be infected with a `bot' - a malicious piece of software which is installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the `botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single hot on a compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding behaviour. The results of the application of the DCA to the detection of a single hot show that the algorithm is a successful technique for the detection of such malicious software without responding to normally running programs.

AB One of the major threats to cyber security is the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack In our previous projects, PacketScore, ALPi, and other statistical filtering-based approaches defend DDoS attacks via fine-grain comparisons between the measured current traffic profile and the victim's nominal profile. These schemes can tackle virtually all kinds of DDoS attacks, even never-before-seen attack types, due to the underlying statistics-based adaptive differentiation. The viability of those aforementioned statistical filtering defense systems is based on the premise that attackers do not know the victim's nominal traffic profile and, thus, cannot fake legitimate traffic. However, a sophisticated DDoS attacker might circumvent the defense system by discovering the statistical filtering rules and then controlling zombies to generate flooding traffic according to these discovered rules. This type of sophisticated attack seriously threatens the current Internet and has not yet been solved.
   In this paper, we propose a Principal Components Analysis (PCA)-based DDoS defense system, which extracts nominal traffic characteristics by analyzing intrinsic dependency across multiple attribute values. The PCA-based scheme differentiates attacking packets from legitimate ones by checking if the current traffic volume of the associated attribute value violates the intrinsic dependency of nominal traffic. The correlation among different attributes makes it more difficult for the attacker to accurately discover the statistic filtering rules and, thus, makes it highly robust to cope with new and more sophisticated attacks.

AB Software Transactional Memory (STM) is an attractive basis for the development of language features for concurrent programming. However, the semantics of these features can be delicate and problematic. In this paper we explore the tradeoffs between semantic simplicity, the viability of efficient implementation strategies, and the flexibility of language constructs. Specifically, we develop semantics and type systems for the constructs of the Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME) programming model; our results apply also to other constructs, such as atomic blocks. With this semantics as a point of reference, we study several implementation strategies. We model STM systems that use in-place update, optimistic concurrency, lazy conflict detection, and roll-back. These strategies are correct only under non-trivial assumptions that we identify and analyze. One important source of errors is that some efficient implementations create dangerous "zombie" computations where a transaction keeps running after experiencing a conflict; the assumptions confine the effects of these computations.

AB In order to analyze the emotional content of motions portrayed by different characters, we created real and virtual replicas of an actor exhibiting six basic emotions: sadness, happiness, surprise, fear, anger and disgust. In addition to the video of the real actor, his actions were applied to five virtual body shapes: a low and high resolution virtual counterpart, a cartoon-like character, a wooden mannequin, and a zombie-like character (Figure 1). Participants were asked to rate the actions based on a list of 41 more complex emotions. We found that the perception of emotional actions is highly robust and to the most part independent of the character's body.

AB Malware often contains hidden behavior which is only activated when properly triggered. Well known examples include: the MyDoom worm which DDoS's on particular dates, keyloggers which only log keystrokes for particular sites, and DDoS zombies which are only activated when given the proper command. We call such behavior trigger-based behavior.
   Currently, trigger-based behavior analysis is often performed in a tedious, manual fashion. Providing even a small amount of assistance would greatly assist and speed-up the analysis. In this chapter, we propose that automatic analysis of trigger-based behavior in malware is possible. In particular, we design an approach for automatic trigger-based behavior. detection and analysis using dynamic binary instrumentation and mixed concrete and symbolic execution. Our approach shows that in many cases we can:
   (1) detect the existence of trigger-based behavior, (2) find the conditions that trigger such hidden behavior, and (3) find inputs that satisfy those conditions, allowing us to observe the triggered malicious behavior in a controlled environment. We have implemented MineSweeper, a system utilizing this approach. In our experiments, MineSweeper has successfully identified trigger-based behavior in real-world malware. Although there are many challenges presented by automatic trigger-based behavior detection, MineSweeper shows us that such automatic analysis is possible and encourages future work in this area.

   A. ROMERO'S NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD
SO CONTEMPORARY BUDDHISM
AB A confluence of increasing interest in popular culture as a source for religious inspiration and the growing interest, both popular and scholarly, in zombie-fiction bring together several possibilities for scholarship in the context of religious studies. This paper will present one aspect of the zombie-craze in the light of Buddhist philosophy. The Buddha taught that the illusion of self-ish-ness, and resulting attachments, are the greatest hurdles to achieving nibbana. Through meditating on the decomposing corpse, Buddhists may come to realize the Ten Impurities of the Body, and so come to grips with the impermanence of the self. I will illustrate how George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, recognized as the watershed film of the modern zombie sub-genre, unintentionally conveys the Buddhist teachings of dukkha (suffering by attachments), anatta (no-self), and anicca (impermanence).

AB Focusing on the challenges of environmental change and human impact, the authors consider how different mindsets or mental maps lead to alternative risk responses and, consequently, alternative prioritizations of different kinds of security. The uncertainties associated with environmental change are difficult to quantify, yet the impacts may be severe. We argue that we cannot so reduce the uncertainty of the science that can definitively end debate about appropriate policy. Instead, we must learn to integrate uncertainty into decision making processes and consider how our near-term actions enable or constrain future options. Presenting a critical approach to defining human and environmental security, we also distinguish between threats and vulnerabilities and their impact. To examine the relationships between security and risk, we draw on two central metaphors. First, the tenets of traditional security are critiqued vis-a-vis Ulrich Beck's "zombie concepts" of modernism, which emphasize the state and thereby fail to engage the multiple and interdependent processes of change we now face. In this context, we discuss broadly how new solutions beget increased risk and how new knowledge yields greater uncertainty. Second, using P.H. Liotta's "boomerang effect," we look more narrowly at how policies intended to address some specific dimension of security can undermine other dimensions. When these metaphors are considered as a set of related ideas, it becomes apparent that the world is confronted with socially produced and human-centered vulnerabilities. Further, the potential for local and localized risk has mutated into systemic risk that affects both the "developing" and "developed" parts of the world. Responses to climated change, in particular, must therefore accommodate thinking in terms of multiple facets of security.

TI Physical scale effects and philosophical thought experiments
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB The scales across which physical properties exist are vast and subtle in their effects on particular systems placed locally on such scales. For example, human experiential access is restricted only to partial segments of the mass density, size, and temperature scales of the universe. I argue that philosophers must learn to appreciate better the effects of physical scales. Specifically, thought experiments in philosophy should be more sensitive to physical scale effects, because the conclusion of a thought experiment may be undermined by unintentionally ignored scale effects, and the changes required to obtain the foreground state of affairs in a thought experiment might require unacknowledged scale-spanning changes to the contextual background. I discuss four philosophical thought experiments: Putnam's Twin Earth and Brain in a Vat, Searle's Chinese Room, and Chalmers's Zombies Without Qualia. I close by briefly defending the greater interest and importance of physical possibility over logical possibility.

AB Distributed Denial-of-service is hard to prevent because the attackers could use the authentic IP addresses of the zombies to hide the source of attacks and to increase the computational ability. In this paper, a game theoretic defending model with puzzle controller against this kind of attack is proposed. T e malicious attackers can be distinguished from legitimate clients by consuming their computational ability dramatically, with the puzzle controller. The proper puzzle difficulty to filter out attackers is also deduced to give an instruction for clients and servers. Meanwhile, the relationships between certain variables are further investigated.

AB Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the latest and most powerful threats that have appeared to the Internet. The main aim of such attacks is to prevent access to resources by legitimate users for which they have authorization. In this paper, a novel Flow-Volume based DDoS detection approach (FVBA) is proposed, which deals with detection of variety of DDoS attacks by monitoring the propagation of abrupt traffic changes inside ISP Domain. Two statistical measures namely Volume and Flow are used as parameters to detect DDoS attacks. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation testbed. Different attack scenarios are implemented by varying total number of zombie machines and at different attack strengths to measure effectiveness of proposed approach. Our simulation results show that FVBA inflicts an extremely high detection rate with low false alarm rate.

AB In modern horror fiction, zombies are generally undead corpses brought back from the dead by supernatural or scientific means, and are rarely under anyone's direct control. They typically have very limited intelligence, and hunger for the flesh of the living [1].
   Typical spectroradiometric or hyperspectral instruments providess calibrated radiances for a number of remote sensing algorithms. The algorithms typically must meet specified latency and availability requirements while yielding products at the required quality. These systems, whether research, operational, or a hybrid, are typically cost constrained. Complexity of the algorithms can be high, and may evolve and mature over time as sensor characterization changes, product validation occurs, and areas of scientific basis improvement are identified and completed. This suggests the need for a systems engineering process for algorithm maintenance that is agile, cost efficient, repeatable, and predictable.
   Experience on remote sensing science data systems suggests the benefits of "plug-n-play" concepts of operation. The concept, while intuitively simple, can be challenging to implement in practice. The use of zombie algorithms-empty shells that outwardly resemble the form, fit, and function of a "complete" algorithm without the implemented theoretical basis-provides the ground systems advantages equivalent to those obtained by integrating sensor engineering models onto the spacecraft bus. Combined with a mature, repeatable process for incorporating the theoretical basis, or scientific core, into the "head" of the zombie algorithm, along with associated scripting and registration, provides an easy "on ramp" for the rapid and low-risk integration of scientific applications into operational systems.

AB Email backscatter is a side effect of email spam, viruses or worms. When a spam or malware-laden email is sent, it nearly always has a forged sender address. If this email fails to reach its recipient, e.g., because the recipient's mailbox is full or the recipient has set up an out-of-the-office auto-responder, the recipient's mail system may attempt to generate and send an automated message replying to the forged sender. This unsolicited message sent to the forged sender is an email backscatter. On massive email spam runs where the same address (or domain) is forged as the sender, there can be significant amounts of backscatter email to the forged address. We consider potential forensic value in the analysis of email backscatter, for example, the times when certain compromised machines were used to send spams. We present results of an analysis performed with our Backscatter Email Analysis Tool (BEAT) of a massive backscatter incident that occurred in mid April, 2008.

AB Should the rules for IT practitioners be the same as are self-imposed by society in general, or something extra? Engineers, and in particular IT professionals, are being called on to take more and more consideration of nontechnical factors when designing their systems. Every system they design is meant to be used (ultimately) by people, and yet people are very diverse and work in unexpected ways. We see this in the manager's role in dealing with his employees, where he now has to cater for their safety, recruitment terms, and what facilities they can and cannot use within the business, for example private e-mail. Information technology itself provides new problems, such as zombies, spam and identity theft. Most importantly, businesses now accumulate vast quantities of digital personal data on their customers. Who is to say how they may or may not use this? Does the IT professional not have a say in what is right, even what is legal? The solutions to this have to be worldwide, and yet most of us can only create a local effect. The best place for an academic to start is in training the future engineers. The paper outlines the background thinking to a Professional & Legal Issues course, given to all second year students of Information Systems, Electronics, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science, at the University of Southampton, UK.

AB This article explores some of the social and cultural factors that have undermined effective treatment and care for persons living with AIDS in South Africa. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Bushbuckridge, I observe that AIDS stigma has been both pervasive and intense. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, I argue that the association of AIDS with sexual promiscuity has not been the major source of its stigma. Instead, I suggest that denial, silence, fear and fatalism have stemmed from the construction of persons living with AIDS as being 'dead before dying', and from their symbolic location in the anomalous domain betwixt-and-between life and death. This article also challenges the notion that older cultural practices in the folk domain impede an effective biomedical response to AIDS. I see the construction of persons with AIDS as 'dead before dying' as an outcome of the manner in which biomedical discourses have articulated with religious and popular ones. In this process the notion that AIDS is a fatal terminal illness carries as much symbolic weight as the popular association of persons suffering from AIDS with lepers and zombies.

SO GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNAL
AB This Article addresses the prospects of liberal democracy in non-Western societies. It focuses on South Africa, one of the newest and most admired liberal democracies, and in particular on its efforts to recognize indigenous African traditions surrounding witchcraft and related occult practices. In 2004, Parliament passed a law that purports to regulate certain occult practitioners called traditional heaters. Today, lawmakers are under pressure to go further and criminalize the practice of witchcraft itself. This Article presses two arguments. First, it contends that the 2004 statute is compatible with liberal principles of equal citizenship and the rule of law. Second, it warns against outlawing witchcraft as such. Subjecting suspected sorcerers to criminal punishment based on governmental determinations of guilt that many will perceive to be unprincipled would work too much damage to individual autonomy and national unity, among other values. These arguments are designed to contribute to a wider discussion about the capacity of liberalism to respond to the global resurgence of religious traditionalism, especially in countries where traditionalists may comprise a large majority of the citizenry.

I seek to turn the tables on 'zombists' by showing that a parallel argument can be run for physicalism. This argument invokes anti-zombies, purely physical creatures which are conscious. I show that using the same resources as those employed by zombists, it is possible to construct an argument from the conceivability of anti-zombies to the truth of physicalism. I go on to defend the claim that anti-zombies are conceivable, and to argue that the anti-zombie argument can be defeated only at the cost of rendering the zombie argument itself redundant. The moral is that dualists should not he zombists.

TI What reaching teaches: Consciousness, control, and the inner zombie
SO BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB What is the role of conscious visual experience in the control and guidance of human behaviour? According to some recent treatments, the role is surprisingly indirect. Conscious visual experience, on these accounts, serves the formation of plans and the selection of action types and targets, while the control of 'online' visually guided action proceeds via a quasi-independent non-conscious route. In response to such claims, critics such as (Wallhagen [2007], pp. 539-61) have suggested that the notions of control and guidance invoked are unacceptably vague, and that that the image of 'zombie systems' guiding action fails to take account of the possibility that there is genuine but unconceptualized, unnoticed, and/or unreportable experience taking place and guiding or controlling the actions. I address both sets of concerns. I try to show that refining and clarifying the key notions of control and guidance leaves the original argument intact, as does the appeal to unconceptualized, unnoticed, or unreportable experiences. The exercise serves, however, to highlight an important complex of considerations concerning the relations between control, agency, and experience. Better understanding these relations is, I suggest, an important source of insights concerning the nature of phenomenal experience.

TI Could a robot have a subjective point of view?
SO JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
AB Scepticism about the possibility of machine consciousness comes in at least two forms. Some argue that our neurobiology is special, and only something sharing our neurobiology could be a subject of experience. Others argue that a machine couldn't be anything else but a zombie: there could never be something it is like to be a machine. I advance a dynamic sensorimotor account of consciousness which argues against both these varieties of scepticism.

TI Evolution of a forced stratified mixing layer
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB Laboratory measurements were carried out in a spatially developing stably stratified shear layer generated downstream of a splitter plate. The instabilities were controlled using a flapper spanning the entire shear layer, with the flapper forced at the fastest growing frequency of the primary [Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)] instability. The measurements were taken as the KH instabilities roll up, break down, and degenerate into stratified turbulence. Both stratified and homogeneous shear layers were considered, the latter acting as the "baseline" case. The measurements included the streamwise and vertical velocities (made using X-wire hot film probes), which allowed calculation of the mean and rms velocities, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation, and TKE production. The density and its gradients were measured using miniature conductivity probes. The measurements and flow visualization elicited interesting features of KH evolution, namely that KH billows may be turbulent from the onset, the TKE dissipation is largest at early stages of evolution, the production of TKE is a maximum at the breakdown of billows, the decay of turbulence to fossilized motions and concomitant formation of fine (layered) structure occur rapidly after the breakdown of billows, and episodic rebirth of (zombie) turbulence develops before a final permanently fossilized state is achieved.

TI Internet forensics on the basis of evidence gathering with Peep attacks
SO COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES
AB The Peep attack is a variant application of a Botnet. This paper proposes a forensic procedure to analyze the attack behavior and explains how to carry out a computer crime investigation. We also discuss the well-known Botnets engaged in the execution of a Peep attack. In our paper, we describe a Peep attack on the Internet as the paradigm of how a cyber-investigator needs to act in the case of a Cybercrime. When cyber detectives prepare to investigate a break in cyber security, there are some issues they must keep in mind and face up to. It is crucial to swiftly preserve digital evidence and conduct forensic analysis that any useful evidence is seized soon after the cybercrime has been committed. Furthermore, there are two phases of digital forensic analysis to retrieve useful evidence when facing a cybercrime attack in our scheme. One phase observes the Internet attack action, and the other one introduces how to investigate each case in on-line analysis of sniffing packets and off-line examination of abnormal files. We believe that this analysis model is workable for any other form of Botnets presently being used. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Zombie fire ant workers: behavior controlled by decapitating fly
   parasitoids
SO INSECTES SOCIAUX
AB Laboratory observations were conducted on four separate red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, colonies that contained workers parasitized by the decapitating fly, Pseudacteon tricuspis. Parasitized S. invicta workers remained inside the nest during parasitoid larval development and left the nest approximately 8-10 hours before decapitation by the parasitoid. When parasitized ants left the nest, they were highly mobile, were responsive to tactile stimuli, and showed minimal defensive behavior. Ants ultimately entered into a grass thatch layer, where they were decapitated and the fly maggots pupariated. This study reveals that parasitized ants exhibit behaviors that are consistent with host manipulation to benefit survival of the parasitoid.

TI On the conditional analysis of phenomenal concepts
SO PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB Zombies make trouble for physicalism. Intuitively, they seem conceivable, and many take this to support their metaphysical possibility - a result that, most agree, would refute physicalism. John Hawthorne (2002) [Philosophical Studies 109, 17-52] and David Braddon-Mitchell (2003) [The Journal of Philosophy 100, 111-135] have developed a novel response to this argument: phenomenal concepts have a conditional structure - they refer to non-physical states if such states exist and otherwise to physical states - and this explains the zombie intuition. I argue that this strategy fails. The considerations Hawthorne and Braddon-Mitchell adduce in support of their analysis in fact do no such thing. Further, their main argument for the analysis is self-defeating: exactly similar reasoning would undermine the view it is meant to establish. Finally, on closer inspection the conditional analysis is incompatible with the zombie intuition. Thus, not only is the analysis incapable of explaining the intuition: the intuition's plausibility indicates that the analysis is incorrect. I also suggest that the allure of the conditional-analysis strategy may derive from a questionable view about what explaining the intuition would require.

TI Stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs about treatment and psychiatric
   medications for children with mental illness
SO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
AB Objectives: Data on community responses to two treatment issues critical for children and adolescents with mental health problems are addressed: stigma associated with receiving mental health care and the willingness to use psychiatric medication. Methods: Using a representative sample of the U. S. population, the investigators interviewed 1,393 noninstitutionalized adult participants in the National Stigma Study Children (NSS-C) ( response rate 70%; margin of error +/- 4%). Results: Many respondents believed that stigma results from mental health treatment during childhood (45% reported likely rejection at school) and that stigma continues to have negative ramifications into adulthood (43%). More than half (57%) were skeptical about confidentiality, and more than one-third (35%) expected parents of children with mental illness to experience self-stigma. Most respondents believed that psychiatric medications affect development (68%), give children a flat, "zombie"-like affect (53%), and delay solving "real"behavior-related problems (66%). Most (86%) believed that physicians overmedicate children for common behavioral problems. Women and persons with more education rather than less perceived less stigma resulting from treatment but reported more negative views on medication. Beliefs in medication efficacy and trust in physicians were associated with more positive cultural beliefs. Conclusions: Data on the contemporary cultural context surrounding treatment for children's mental health issues revealed substantial stigma concerns, particularly surrounding medication options. These beliefs and attitudes cannot be easily inferred from adults' sociodemographic characteristics.

AB Today sending spams has turned to be a major problem in the Internet. It is so serious that more than 80% of the transferred emails are spams. As a result, various methods have been proposed for preventing spams. One of these methods in this field is CAPTCHA (Completely Automatic Public Turing Test to tell Computer and Humans Apart) method. They have been developed to prevent automatically made accounts in sites which offer free email accounts.
   In this paper a new protocol is presented for authentication of users which enable us to confirm that a user is a human using CAPTCHA method. By using this protocol for authentication of users, we can design secure mail servers in order to prevent zombie computers sending spams by our server. This protocol has been designed according to CRAM-MD5 protocol and has been implemented under the SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer). This protocol can be implemented easily and enjoys high flexibility and versatility.

AB During fall periods in 2002, 2003 and 2004 three major oceanographic expeditions were carried out in Mamala Bay, Hawaii. These were part of the RASP Remote Anthropogenic Sensing Program. Ikonos and Quickbird optical satellite images of sea surface glint revealed approximate to 100 m spectral anomalies in km(2) averaging patches in regions leading from the Honolulu Sand Island Municipal Outfall diffuser to distances up to 20 km. To determine the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, the RASP expeditions monitored the waters adjacent to the outfall with an array of hydrographic, optical and turbulence microstructure sensors in anomaly and ambient background regions. Drogue tracks and mean turbulence parameters for 2 x 10(4) microstructure patches were analyzed to understand complex turbulence, fossil turbulence and zombie turbulence near-vertical internal wave transport processes. The dominant mechanism appears to be generic to stratified natural fluids including planet and star atmospheres and is termed beamed zombie turbulence maser action (BZTMA). Most of the bottom turbulent kinetic energy is converted to approximate to 100 in fossil turbulence waves. These activate secondary (zombie) turbulence in outfall fossil turbulence patches that transmit heat, mass, chemical species, momentum and information vertically to the sea surface for detection in an efficient maser action. The transport is beamed in intermittent mixing chimneys.

AB MobZombies is a combination wearable sensor device and mobile game with a unique user interface. The game control requires physical, embodied movement that couples the wearable sensor to the game play. By walking or running and turning the wearable sensor controls the action within the game. We use a small sensor platform custom designed for MobZombies, together with software written for a hand-held computer, which serves as the main computational and display device. In the MobZombies game, the player is being chased by a swarm of brain-eating zombies and must move their avatar by using their body motion to direct the avatar away from the attacking swarm. This project is an investigation directed to research the use of wearable sensors as a platform for electronic games that are inspired from the physical nature of traditional pre-digital playground activities.

TI The afterimage - traces of otherness in recent Singaporean cinema
SO INTER-ASIA CULTURAL STUDIES
AB In this essay, Ho Tzu Nyen attempts to unearth a subterranean narrative that threads through three films produced by three male Singaporean directors - namely Mee Pok Man ( 1995) by Eric Khoo, 15 ( 2003) by Royston Tan, and Zombie Dogs ( 2004) by Toh Hai Leong. This narrative of unconsciously repeated motifs that migrate from film to film is in turn analyzed as a recurrent symptom that haunts a number of Singaporean cinematic productions from the 1990s onwards. This symptom, which can be summarily described as a paranoid relationship to 'otherness', makes manifest a variety of psychic tendencies such as morbid fear of impotence, misogyny, and fetishization of the social other. For Ho, such impulses are in turn intricately linked to what he, following the literary critic Harold Bloom, calls 'The Anxiety of Influence'. For Bloom, every poet embarks upon his career after a prior encounter with another poet, or poem. As a result, the 'late-coming' poet inevitably suffers from a sense of threatened autonomy, because his profoundest insights and deepest desires are always already elucidated by another. For the Singaporean filmmaker, Ho argues that this 'anxiety' in relation to the cinematic tradition takes on a peculiar nature and a doubled pressure, for the canon that inspires them is perceived as being something essentially foreign. Hence the Singaporean filmmaker makes cinema as though he is stuttering in a foreign tongue. Therefore, the concept of 'the anxiety of influence' is modulated and compounded with a 'postcolonial anxiety'. In addition, Ho also draws upon the concepts of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze in an attempt to sketch out an ontology of cinema that at once functions in a deconstructive relationship to 'auteur-driven' modes of analyses, while avoiding what he perceives as the overly 'sociological' bent that characterizes much of the existing corpus of writings on Singaporean cinema.

TI Ten Models of Consciousness That Are None

AB Ten models of consciousness are discussed. The models are proposed by individuals who do not seem to understand "the hard problem of phenomenal consciousness". presumably because they have no qualia themselves. As the Zombie's proposals are dismissed, the quality of their comments and contributions rises. It is concluded that no premature solution to the hard problem should be proposed at this point; instead it is suggested that the problem must first be appreciated to full extent by scientists and students of all faculties dealing with information processing in the human brain. Ultimately the question is why the brain, when in a particular state, experiences its own activity qualitatively. The answer to that question will probably expand the current ontology of physics.

AB The growing popularity of wireless networks and mobile devices is starting to attract unwanted attention especially as potential targets for malicious activities reach critical mass. In this study, we try to quantify the threat from large-scale distributed attacks on wireless networks, and, more specifically, wifi networks in densely populated metropolitan areas. We focus on three likely attack scenarios: "wildfire" worms that can spread contagiously over and across wireless LANs, coordinated citywide phishing campaigns based on wireless spoofing, and rogue systems for compromising location privacy in a coordinated fashion. The first attack illustrates how dense wifi deployment may provide opportunities for attackers who want to quickly compromise large numbers of machines. The last two attacks illustrate how botnets can amplify wifi vulnerabilities, and how botnet power is amplified by wireless connectivity.
   To quantify these threats, we rely on real-world data extracted from wifi maps of large metropolitan areas in the States and Singapore. Our results suggest that a carefully crafted wireless worm can infect up to 80% of all wifi connected hosts in some metropolitan areas within 20 minutes, and that an attacker can launch phishing attacks or build a tracking system to monitor the location of 10-50% of wireless users in these metropolitan areas with just 1, 000 zombies under his control.

We investigate how existing techniques for modeling the acquisition of fluent skill can be adapted to the context of an educational action game, Zombie Division. We discuss why this adaptation is necessarily different for educational action games than for other types of games, such as turn-based games. We demonstrate that gain in accuracy over time is straightforward to model using exponential learning curves, but that models of gain in speed over time must also take gameplay learning into account.

AB Focusing on the zombie-film 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle) may at first sight seem an odd choice in the context of utopian writing, but links to utopia can in fact be drawn on various levels. Zombies, like utopia itself, can function as a means to comment on or criticize present society; the creation of zombies in 28 Days Later is linked to an utopian ideal, the elimination of rage; and the film can be read as a quest for a utopian space in a pastoral setting. Thus, the film is discussed as a self-referential mixture of genres, that combines dystopia with apocalypse, utopia with the pastoral, and that ironically undercuts all its generic statements.

To fight these threats and ensure network reliability, early detection of these attacks is critical. Many methods have been developed with limited success to date. This paper presents an approach that identifies change points in the time series of network packet arrival rates. The proposed process has two stages: (i) statistical analysis that finds the rate of increase of network traffic, and (ii) wavelet analysis of the network statistics that quickly detects the sudden increases in packet arrival rates characteristic of botnet attacks. Most intrusion detections are tested using data sets from special security testing configurations, which leads to unacceptable false positive rates being found when they are used in the real world. We test our approach using data from both network simulations and a large operational network. The true and false positive detection rates are determined for both data sets, and receiver operating curves use these rates to find optimal parameters for our approach. Evaluation using operational data proves the effectiveness of our approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The zombie stalking english schools: Social class and educational
   inequality
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
AB The aim of this article is to reclaim social class as a central concern within education, not in the traditional sense as a dimension of educational stratification, but as a powerful and vital aspect of both learner and wider social identities. Drawing on historical and present evidence, a case is made that social inequalities arising from social class have never been adequately addressed within schooling. Recent qualitative research is used to indicate some of the ways in which class is lived in classrooms. The article also raises concerns about the ability of the education system to positively address social class in the classroom when contemporary initial teacher training rarely engages with it as a relevant concern within schooling.

SO GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
AB This article addresses abject representations of the feminized body and home. Abjection plays a key role in the creation of ambiguity and unease, encompassing the paradoxes of transgression, which is key to the critical examination of social relations and constructions. I conduct an investigation of portrayals of abject spaces in two sites, the body and the home, which are analyzed through three films: I Walked with a Zombie (1943), Evil Dead II (1987) and The Others (2001). In my analysis, I show how these films repeatedly portray feminized bodies and homes that, when transgressive, are seen as abject until order is re-established at the conclusion of the film. In these horror texts, boundaries dissolve and create potentially progressive moments which can disturb gendered norms and binaries, but ultimately, the boundaries are reified and re-normed, reinscribing patriarchal gender coatings of space.

TI Human zombies are metaphysically impossible
SO SYNTHESE
AB Chalmers (The Conscious Mind, Oxford Unversity Press, Oxford 1996) has argued for a form of property dualism on the basis of the concept of a zombie (which is physically identical to normals), and the concept of the inverted spectrum. He asserts that these concepts show that the facts about consciousness, such as experience or qualia, are really further facts about our world, over and above the physical facts. He claims that they are the hard part of the mind-body issue. He also claims that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the world like mass, charge, etc.
   He says that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical and all current attempts to assert an identity between consciousness and the physical are just as non-reductive as his dualism. They are simply correlations and are part of the problem of the explanatory gap. In this paper, three examples of strong identities between a sensation or a quale and a physiological process are presented, which overcome these problems. They explain the identity in an a priori manner and they show that consciousness or sensations (Q) logically supervene on the physical (P), in that it is logically impossible to have P and not to have Q. In each case, the sensation was predicted and entailed by the physical. The inverted spectrum problem for consciousness is overcome and explained by a striking asymmetry in colour space. It is concluded that as some physical properties realize some sensations or qualia that human zombies are not metaphysically possible and the explanatory gap is bridged in these cases. Thus, the hard problem is overcome in these instances.

TI Tropical rodents change rapidly germinating seeds into long-term food
   supplies
SO OIKOS
AB Seed-hoarding vertebrates may survive yearly periods of food scarcity by storing seeds during the preceding fruiting season. It is poorly understood why rodents creating long-term reserves, especially those in the tropics, incorporate seeds from plant species that germinate rapidly and hence seem unsuitable for long-term storage. We carried out a series of experiments to understand why red acouchies (Myoprocta exilis) scatter-hoard Carapa procera (Meliaceae) seeds, which lack dormancy and germinate rapidly. Hypotheses tested were: (1) even germinated seeds are still significant long-term energy reserves for acouchies, (2) acouchies use the seeds only as short-term supplies, and (3) acouchies manipulate the seeds to slow down germination. The first two hypotheses were not supported; seed reserves were rapidly depleted during experimental planting, and acouchies did use seeds for long-term storage. We did find support for the third hypothesis. Acouchies intervened in germination by removing the protruding radicle and epicotyl after which they re-cached seeds. Pruning stopped further seedling development, yet the pruned seeds did not decay. The cotyledons apparently stayed alive and physiologically active as "zombie seeds" that only formed undifferentiated calli. Pruned seeds were suitable for long-term storage, with negligible loss of endosperm over time. Pruning was most effective after sprouting of the epicotyl, and germinating seeds were most susceptible to pruning during two weeks upon emergence. Acouchies actively managed their food supplies and must continuously survey for germinating seeds to timely intervene in seed reserve depletion, within the brief period of seedling emergence. We suggest that the trees use the rodents to achieve seed dispersal, and gain from imperfect intervention in germination by the rodents. Because scatter-hoarding rodents and large-seeded plant species with similar germination co-occur in tropical forests world-wide, it is plausible that the phenomenon of seed pruning to preserve seeds is more general than currently appreciated.

TI Conscious objections: God and the consciousness debates
SO ZYGON
AB Consciousness studies are dogged with religious overtones, and many researchers fight hard against Christian ideas of soul or anything supernatural. This gives many studies on consciousness a particular relevance to religious belief. Many writers assume that, if consciousness can be explained physically, religious belief in a soul- and perhaps religious belief itself-must be false. Theorists of consciousness grapple with questions of materialism and reduction in trying to understand how the physical brain can produce the bizarre sensations that we call ourselves. In this essay I discuss the problems in trying to separate religion from science in such a "fuzzy" area as consciousness. I look at the question of what precisely theories of consciousness are trying to explain. I consider theories from David Chalmers, Daniel Dennett, and Roger Penrose as examples of different approaches. Although all of these are materialistically based, I argue that they do not necessarily demonstrate the nonexistence of a soul and also that religious belief does not necessarily require belief in a nonmaterial soul. I conclude with a discussion of why a physical/materialist explanation of consciousness is desired and how religious bias is still a problem in this scientific/philosophical field.

TI Electoral incentives in mixed-member systems: Party, posts, and zombie
   politicians in Japan
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB How do electoral incentives affect legislative organization? Through an analysis of Japan's mixed-member electoral system, we demonstrate that legislative organization is strongly influenced not only by the individual legislators reelection incentives but also by their interest in their party gaining power and maintaining a strong party label. Electorally vulnerable legislators are given choice legislative positions to enhance their prospects at the polls, whereas (potential) party leaders disproportionately receive posts with greater influence on the party's overall reputation. Members of Parliament elected from proportional representation (PR) lists and in single member districts also receive different types of posts, reflecting their distinct electoral incentives. Even small variations in electoral rules can have important consequences for legislative organization. In contrast to Germany's compensatory mixed-member system, Japan's parallel system (combined with a "best loser" or "zombie" provision) generates incentives for the party to allocate posts relating to the distribution of particularistic goods to those elected in PR.

AB This paper explores the possibility that the human mind underwent substantial changes in recent history. Assuming that consciousness is a substantial trait of the mind, the paper focuses on the suggestion made by Julian Jaynes that the Mycenean Greeks had a "bicameral'' mind instead of a conscious one. The suggestion is commonly dismissed as patently absurd, for instance by critics such as Ned Block. A closer examination of the intuitions involved, considered from different theoretical angles (social constructivism, idealism, eliminativism, realism), reveals that the idea of 'Greek zombies' should be taken more seriously than is commonly assumed.

TI Economics of the living dead
SO JAPANESE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Zombie firms are those firms that are insolvent and have little hope of recovery but avoid failure thanks to support from their banks. This paper identifies zombie firms in Japan, and compares the characteristics of zombies to other firms. Zombie firms are found to be less profitable, more indebted, more dependent on their main banks, more likely to be found in non-manufacturing industries and more often located outside large metropolitan areas. Overall, larger size makes the firm less likely to be a zombie, but among small firms, relatively larger firms are more likely to be protected and become zombies. Controlling for profitability, the exit probability for zombie firms does not differ from that for non-zombies. Zombie firms tend to increase employment by more (but do not reduce employment by more) than non-zombies. Finally, when the proportion of zombie firms in an industry increases, job creation declines and job destruction increases, and the effects are stronger for non-zombies.

TI Zombies and the case of the phenomenal pickpocket
SO SYNTHESE
AB A prevailing view in contemporary philosophy of mind is that zombies are logically possible. I argue, via a thought experiment, that if this prevailing view is correct, then I could be transformed into a zombie. If I could be transformed into a zombie, then surprisingly, I am not certain that I am conscious. Regrettably, this is not just an idiosyncratic fact about my psychology; I think you are in the same position. This means that we must revise or replace some important positions in the philosophy of mind. We could embrace radical skepticism about our own consciousness, or maintain the complete and total infallibility of our beliefs about our own phenomenal experiences. I argue that we should actually reject the logical possibility of zombies.

AB Filtering unsolicited messages in recipients' inboxes and restricting them at the mail server or transit agent level are two practical ways to confine spam. However, none of them prevents spam messages from leaving the source machines and flooding the Internet. In this paper, we present a method of preventing outgoing spam from entering the network by correlating user activities with the outbound network traffic. The Message Intentability Scoring Algorithm (MISA) is proposed to assess the intentability of the outgoing messages and an outgoing spam prevention system is designed based on this algorithm. This idea can be used to build standalone outgoing spam prevention or an extension of Host-based Intrusion Prevention System.

AB The problem of attacks where sophisticated communities, such as BLACKHAT users, compromised larger and larger number of unsuspecting (and unsuspected) home personal computers in an effort to launch major attacks on both Government and corporate networks will be addressed in this manuscript. We called these attacks "Swarm Attacks", like a "swarm of bees". The SLAMMER, which is currently the fastest computer worm in recorded history, is an early precursor to this class of threat. Most proposed countermeasures strategies proposed to deal with such attacks, are based primarily on rate detection and limiting algorithms, or the detection of a sudden increased occurrence of "Destination Unreachable", messages in a network. However, we speculate that such strategies will prove ineffective in the future. In this manuscript we will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of such "Swarm Worms", the nature of the intelligent behavior that emerges, as well as the basic structure required in order to be considered a "swarm worm", based on our definition. We will present preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such swarm worm, called the ZachiK worm. It will be shown that ZachiK is capable of propagating at a rate 2 orders of magnitude faster than similar worms without swarm capabilities.

Instead of specific solution, a comprehensive DDoS cure is needed which can combat against the previously and upcoming DDoS attack vulnerabilities. Development of such solution requires understanding of all those aspects which can help hacker to activate zombies and launch DDoS attack.
   In this paper, we comprehensively analyzed the DDoS problem and we proposed a simplified taxonomy to categorize the attack scope and available defense solutions. This taxonomy can help the software developers and security practitioners to understand the common vulnerabilities that encourage the attackers to launch DDoS attack.

AB This paper analyzed the features of the flooding-based DoS/DDoS attack traffic, and proposed a novel real-time algorithm for detecting such DoS/DDoS attacks. In order to shorten the delay of detection, short-term traffic prediction was introduced, and prediction values were used in the detecting process. Though we use real-time traffic data to calculate the mean and variance, few periods of data need to be stored because the algorithm is a recurring process, therefore the occupied storage space is less. Moreover, the complex and cost of the recurring process is less than calculating the whole sequence, so the load of the server would not increase much. Although we focus our research on detecting flooding-based DoS/DDoS attacks, the simulation shows that the approach also can deal with DDoS attacks that zombies start without simultaneousness.

Distributed Denial-of-service can make the service requests become hard to implement. An intrusion tolerant mechanism against the attack is formalized for Grid services based on the mechanism design analysis of game theory in this paper. The problems that the attackers could use the authentic IP addresses of the zombies to hide the source of attacks and to increase the computational ability and the likelihood to filter out legitimate traffic are effectively settled under the mechanism. The condition for the legitimate clients being served successfully is further deduced to give an instruction for clients.

TI Descartes' argument for dualism in contemporary philosophy of mind
SO PROBLEMOS
AB The paper analizes Descartes' argument for the mind-body dualism from the perspective of contemporary analytical philosophy of mind. It attempts to show that the popular zombie argument, mostly due to David Chalmers, is reminescent of this Cartesian proof of dualism. The intended conclusion is that although the contemporary argument invokes modal semantic analysis and two-dimensional theory of conceptual content and so is technically more difficult and resistant to certain physicalist criticism, it neverhteless rests on an unstated and unjustified assumption. This assumption is that of epistemic transparency and completeness of at least some of our concepts. It was the same assumption that had been identified as one of the weaknesses of the original Cartesian argument for dualism. Therefore, one could argue that Arnauld's objections to Descartes are well applicable to Chalmers' antiphysicalist arguments without substantial modification.

AB This paper has three goals. The first is to introduce the "knowledge game", a new, simple and yet powerful tool for analysing some intriguing philosophical questions. The second is to apply the knowledge game as an informative test to discriminate between conscious (human) and conscious-less agents (zombies and robots), depending on which version of the game they can win. And the third is to use a version of the knowledge game to provide an answer to Dretske's question "how do you know you are not a zombie?".

TI Witches and zombies of the South African lowveld: Discourse, accusations
   and subjective reality
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
AB Anthropological studies generally interpret discourses about witches and zombies in sub-Saharan Africa as critical commentary oil the emergence of new forms of wealth, the commodification of labour, and the crisis of reproduction. Drawing on data collected in the Bushbuckridge area of the South African lowveld, I point to the limitations of these arguments and suggest that we call more fully capture the diverse and contradictory meanings of witches and zombies by separating discourses from actual accusations and from subjective realities. Whilst generic discourses highlight the use of zombies as a means of accumulating wealth, those accused of witchcraft are nearly always subordinate and impoverished persons who allegedly keep zombies as a means of survival. At the same time, these beliefs are connected to powerful psychological motivations, such as emotionally overwhelming experiences of bereavement, loss, and mourning. I suggest that witches and zombies derive their broad appeal from indeterminacy that defies interpretive control and constantly allows for alternative interpretations.

AB In order to help frame a current theoretical impasse, in this essay we forward the figure of the zombie in Western cinema as an allegory for the reception of the concept of ideology by communication scholars. After noting parallels between (a) an early academic caricature of ideology and the laboring zombie, and (b) the subject of ideological interpellation and the ravenous, consuming zombie of more recent cinema, we suggest that rhetorical scholars have yet to move beyond an obsession with the laboring zombie. To escape the connotation of a totalizing determinism that haunts ideology critique, we urge an acceptance of the category of the unconscious and a focus on ideology as a force of subjectification.

Those that fail to embrace and use such advantages in the next years are in danger to disappear or become zombie ones. In contrast, those pioneering these next-generation technology-business strategies will gain strategic advantage. This paper is about A WS-Net Traveler, which is an Autonomic Web Services Framework for performing Business Processes in an Autonomous mode. The main feature of this proposal is a decentralized architecture that heavily relies on Peer-to-Peer Web Service Brokers to coordinate, plan and perform Web Service choreographies. We introduce the Architecture of a WS-Net Traveler and the description of their main components.

CY JUN 06-10, 2005

AB The problem of spam is a classic "tragedy of the commons" [10]. We propose the Zmail protocol as a way to preserve email as a "free" common resource for most users, while imposing enough cost on bulk mailers so that market forces will control the volume of spam. A key idea behind Zmail is that the most important resource consumed by email is not the transmission process but the end user's attention. Zmail requires the sender of an email to pay a small amount (called an "e-penny") which is paid directly to the receiver of the email.
   Zmail is thus a "zero-sum" email protocol. Users who receive as much email as they send, on average, will neither pay nor profit from email, once they have set up initial balances with their ESPs (Email Service Providers) to buffer the fluctuations. Spammers will incur costs that will moderate their behavior. Importantly, Zmail requires no definition of what is and is not spam, so spammers' efforts to evade such definitions become irrelevant. We describe methods within Zmail for supporting "free" goods such as volunteer mailing lists, and for limiting exploitation by email viruses and zombies.
   Zmail is not a micro-payment scheme among end-users. It is an accounting relationship among "compliant ESPs", which reconcile payments to and from their users. Zmail can be implemented on top of the existing SMTP email protocol. We describe an incremental deployment strategy that can start with as few as two compliant ESPs and provides positive feedback for growth as Zmail spreads over the Internet.

TI A different way of being - Adolescents' experiences with cancer
SO CANCER NURSING
AB Adolescents with cancer face many challenges that may impact negatively their psychological well-being. In evaluating the psychosocial functioning of adolescents with cancer, research suggests that an altered self-image may emerge in those who have difficulty adjusting. However, little is known about adolescents' perceptions of how cancer affects their sense of self. Part of a larger study, this article addresses findings specific to understanding the impact that cancer and its symptoms had on adolescents' sense of self. To help discover meaningful interpretations of their experiences, a longitudinal, qualitative study was conducted. Data collection methods included open-ended, individual and focus group interviews and participant observation. The constant comparative method of data analysis yielded theoretical categories that were supported by the adolescents' narratives. Findings revealed that adolescents experienced changes in their lived bodies because of the symptoms and this, in turn, impacted their sense of self and way of being in the world. Six ways of being in the world were identified: life as a klutz; life as a prisoner; life as an invalid; life as an alien; life as a zombie; and life as a kid. In helping adolescents deal with the changes, it was important to family and friends to respond to them like they were the same person, but also to treat them special at times. Although adolescents spoke to the significance that cancer had on their lives, they described themselves as "still being pretty muck the same person."

AB DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is the most troublesome attack nowadays, especially for those people whose operational environment relies on network services and/or the Internet. However, attackers often penetrate innocent routers and hosts to make them unwittingly participate in such a large scale attack as zombies or reflectors. In this paper, we propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), named CUSUM Intrusion Detection System (CIDS), which invokes CUSUM as its detection algorithm and logically divides Internet into many autonomous network management units (NMUs), each deploys a CIDS to discover attacks and identify what role a client in such an attack acts as.

AB The fair bandwidth allocations can isolate flows and protect well-behaved flows from ill-behaved ones. CSFQ (Core Stateless Fair Queueing) achieves the approximate fairness by dropping the extra packets beyond the fair share bandwidth at the routers. A heuristic method is used to estimate the fair share in CSFQ. Furthermore, we know that SRED (Stabilized RED) uses a probabilistic method based on a Zombie list to estimate the number of flows at the router In this paper we take the probabilistic idea from SRED and apply it in CSFQ to estimate the fair share without using the Zombie list. Simulation results show that the new probabilistic approach achieves a comparable or even better performance than the original heuristic approach.

AB We present gore, a routing-assisted defense architecture against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that provides guaranteed levels of access to a network under attack. Our approach uses routing to redirect all traffic destined to a customer under attack to strategically-located gore proxies, where servers filter out attack traffic and forward authorized traffic toward its intended destination.
   Our architecture can be deployed incrementally by individual ISPs, does not require any collaboration between ISPs, and requires no modifications to either server- or client- software. Clients can be authorized through a web interface that screens legitimate users from outsiders or automated zombies. Authenticated clients are granted limited-time access to the network under attack. The gore architecture allows ISPs to offer DDoS defenses as a value-added service, providing necessary incentives for the deployment of such defenses. We constructed a PC-based testbed to evaluate the performance and scalability of gore. Our preliminary results show that gore is a viable approach, as its impact on the filtered traffic is minimal, in terms of both end-to-end latency and effective throughput. Furthermore, gore can easily be scaled up as needed to support larger numbers of clients and customers using inexpensive commodity PCs.

CY JUL 31-AUG 05, 2005
CL Baltimore, MD
SP USENIX Assoc
AB There is a growing interest in designing high-speed network devices to perform packet processing at semantic levels above the network layer. Some examples are layer-7 switches, content inspection and transformation systems, and network intrusion detection/prevention systems. Such systems must maintain per-flow state in order to correctly perform their higher-level processing. A basic operation inherent to per-flow state management for a transport protocol such as TCP is the task of reassembling any out-of-sequence packets delivered by an underlying unreliable network protocol such as IP. This seemingly prosaic task of reassembling the byte stream becomes an order of magnitude more difficult to soundly execute when conducted in the presence of an adversary whose goal is to either subvert the higher-level analysis or impede the operation of legitimate traffic sharing the same network path.
   We present a design of a hardware-based high-speed TCP reassembly mechanism that is robust against attacks. It is intended to serve as a module used to construct a variety of network analysis systems, especially intrusion prevention systems. Using trace-driven analysis of out-of-sequence packets, we first characterize the dynamics of benign TCP traffic and show how we can leverage the results to design a reassembly mechanism that is efficient when dealing with non-attack traffic. We then refine the mechanism to keep the system effective in the presence of adversaries. We show that although the damage caused by an adversary cannot be completely eliminated, it is possible to mitigate the damage to a great extent by careful design and resource allocation. Finally, we quantify the trade-off between resource availability and damage from an adversary in terms of Zombie equations that specify, for a given configuration of our system, the number of compromised machines an attacker must have under their control in order to exceed a specified notion of "acceptable collateral damage."

TI Individualisation and inequalities in health: a qualitative study of
   class identity and health
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB It has been argued that social class, if not dead, is at least a 'zombie category' in contemporary Western society. However, epidemiological evidence shows that class-based inequalities have either persisted or widened, despite overall improvements in the health of Western populations. This article presents an exploratory qualitative study of the individualisation of class identity and health conducted in a southern English city. Findings are presented in consideration of two competing argumentative positions around which participants worked to negotiate class identity and health. The first of these positions denied the significance of class for identity and health and was associated with the individualised heroic and stoic narratives of working class identity. The second position acknowledged the reality of class relations and their implications for health and identity, being associated with structurally and politically orientated narratives of middle class identity. In sum, resistance to class was associated with talk about individual, private experience whereas the acceptance of class was linked to discussion of health as a wider social or political phenomenon. This evidence lends qualified support to the individualisation thesis: inequalities in health existing on structural or material levels are not simply reproduced, and indeed in some contexts may even juxtapose, accounts of social identity in interview and focus group contexts. Class identity and health are negotiated in lay talk as participants shift argumentatively back and forth between competing positions, and public and private realms, in the attempt to make sense of health and illness. The promotion of greater awareness and interest in health inequalities within wider public discourse may well help support attempts to tackle these injustices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Thought experiments alleged to feature zombies founder on the fact that, on the one hand, they must involve first-person imagining, and yet, on the other hand, cannot. Philosophers who take themselves to have imagined zombies have unwittingly conflated imagining a creature who lacks consciousness with imagining a creature without also imagining the consciousness it may or may not possess.

My arguments are unusual insofar as they rely neither on an implicit commitment to logical behaviourism in any of its various forms nor to a verifications it theory of meaning. Nor do they depend upon prior metaphysical commitments or to philosophical 'intuitions'. Rather, in assembling reminders about how the application of our consciousness and propositional attitude concepts are ordinarily defended, I argue on explanatory and moral grounds that they cannot be legitimately withheld from creatures who behave, and who would continue to behave, like us. I urge that we should therefore reject the invitation to revise the application of these concepts in the ways that would be required by recent proposals in the philosophy of mind.

AB A denial of service attack (DOS) is any type of attack on a networking structure to disable a server from servicing its clients. Attacks range from sending millions of requests to a server in an attempt to slow it down, flooding a server with large packets of invalid data, to sending requests with an invalid or spoofed IP address. In this paper we show the implementation and analysis of three main types of attack: Ping of Death, TCP SYN Flood, and Distributed DOS. The Ping of Death attack will be simulated against a Microsoft Windows 95 computer. The TCP SYN Flood attack will be simulated against a Microsoft Windows 2000 IIS FTP Server. Distributed DOS will be demonstrated by simulating a distribution zombie program that will carry the Ping of Death attack. Furthemore, the paper demonstrates the potential damage from DOS attacks and analyzes the ramifications of the damage.

AB To solve the congestion problem, network nodes at near the zombies need to filter the attack traffic. But the amounts of attack packets are small at upstream node and it is hard to detect an occurrence of an attack. In this case, the network node near the protected site should perform attack detection. Our proposed, system uses active network technology and allowing detecting attack at active router near protected server. This detecting process uses dynamic, adaptive detecting algorithm. Elementary classification will reduce network congestion and adaptive classification will reduce error detecting rate. Signatures which are created by these two classifications are transferred to other active routers. And then they perform filtering process based on signatures.

SO PACIFIC PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
AB Two arguments are famously held to support the conclusion that consciousness cannot be explained in purely physical or functional terms - hence, that physicalism is false: the modal argument and the knowledge argument. While anti-physicalists appeal to both arguments, this paper argues there is a methodological incoherence in jointly maintaining them: the modal argument supports the possibility of zombies; but the possibility of zombies undercuts the knowledge argument. At best, this leaves anti-physicalists in a considerably weakened rhetorical position. At worst, it shows that commonsense intuitions on which anti-physicalists rely mislead us about the true nature of conscious experience.

AB Apoptosis is a highly orchestrated form of programmed cell death, and this is believed to contribute to continuous decline of ventricular function in heart failure. However, the apoptotic cascade is not completed in failing myocardium and DNA damage is prevented due to abolition of DNA fragmentation factors. The extranuclear apoptotic program is interrupted secondary to inhibition of activated caspase-3 by upregulated inhibitors of apoptotic process. During the apoptotic process, upstream step comprising extensive mitochondrial loss of cytochrome c may contribute to systolic dysfunction of heart. Intactness of nuclear blueprint underscores the likelihood of reverse remodeling that has been demonstrated in the post-LVAD myocardial specimens.

I shall try to show that, if we reformulate the thesis of physicalism according to Kim's view of physicalism (in terms of the supervenience relation), there is a third option, a version of type physicalism, where physicalism and qualia could be conciliated. In order to sketch this option, I shall consider the main argument against type physicalism: the explanatory gap argument, and two arguments that Kim mentions against physicalism: the inverted spectrum/zombies argument and the intrinsicality argument. I shall try to show that these arguments depend upon a misconception of the nature of our ordinary mental concepts.

The arguments are based on the of alternate worlds in which physical law,,, and properties remain the same, but in which qualia either differ or are absent altogether. This article maintains that qualia are, on the contrary, physical properties in the world.

   among TCP connections
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH SPEED NETWORKS
AB In this paper, we first investigate the fairness between TCP Reno and TCP Vegas by focusing on the situation where Reno and Vegas connections share the bottleneck link. From the analysis and the simulation results, we find that the performance of TCP Vegas is much smaller than that of TCP Reno as opposed to an expectation on TCP Vegas. The RED algorithm improves the fairness to some degree, but there still be an inevitable trade-off between fairness and throughput. Accordingly, we propose a ZL-RED (Zombie Listed RED) algorithm, which enhances the RED algorithm to provide fair service for many flows at the bottleneck router. ZL-RED uses the Zombie List, which has been originally proposed by SRED, to detect mis-behaving flows which send packets at higher rate than others. Then, ZL-RED sets higher packet discarding probabilities for those mis-behaving flows. We evaluate an effectiveness of ZL-RED by simulation experiments, and show that ZL-RED can actually improve fairness among TCP connections.

AB It is desirable to hold network attackers accountable for their actions in both criminal investigations and information warfare situations. Currently, attackers are able to hide their location effectively by creating a chain of connections through a series of hosts. This method is effective because current host audit systems do not maintain enough information to allow association of incoming and outgoing network connections. In this paper, we introduce an inexpensive method that allows both on-line and forensic matching of incoming and outgoing network traffic. Our method associates origin information with each process in the system process table, and enhances the audit information by logging the origin and destination of network sockets. We present implementation results and show that our method can effectively record origin information about the common cases of stepping stone connections and denial of service zombies, and describe the limitations of our approach.

TI Witches and missionaries in nineteenth century Transvaal
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB This article argues that the published and unpublished records of the Berlin Missionary Society in the Transvaal in the nineteenth century are sufficiently rich to allow for at least a partial reconstruction of perceptions and practices with regard to witchcraft in African societies. It also uses the perspective provided by this material to re-interpret a key episode in the history of the region - the clashes between Christian converts and wider Pedi society in the 1860s. The article concludes that concern about witches was profound and pervasive and needs to be given much fuller attention in historical analysis. However, it also argues that the incidence of individuals being either openly accused of, or punished for, witchcraft was low, and that large-scale and lethal witch-hunts were extremely rare. It further suggests that the contemporary, tendency to see women as particularly prone to witchcraft is not paralleled in nineteenth century, accounts and may therefore be the result of processes of social change set in motion late in the century. In addition, it notes that the 'zombies' who have commanded widespread comment and concern in recent years are probably neither as exotic nor as new as some writers have supposed.

Of these, role-play is probably the crucial adaptation which makes us most different from other apes. Human childhood, a sheltered period of 'extended irresponsibility', allows us to develop our powers of make-believe and role-play, prerequisites for human cooperation, culture, and reflective consciousness. Social mirror theory originating with Dilthey Baldwin, Cooley and Mend, holds that there cannot be mirrors in the mind without mirrors in society. I will present evidence from the social and behavioural sciences to argue that self-awareness depends on social mirrors and shared experiential worlds. The dependence of reflectivity on shared experience requires some reframing of the 'hardproblem', and suggests a non-trivial answer to the zombie question.

AB The increasing deployment of overlay networks that rely on DNS tricks has led to added interest in examining DNS traffic. In this paper we report on a characterization of DNS traffic gathered over a period of several weeks at Internet Gateway Routers (IGRs) in the AT&T Common Backbone. The characterization is carried out using several novel techniques to identify clients, local DNS servers, and authoritative DNS servers. Our techniques include passive and active measurements, graph-based analysis, examination of outliers, and explicit checks against data obtained from several external sources. Our contribution is the reduction of a very large data set (over 1 Terabyte of raw data) into a significantly smaller representation that is ideally suited for answering protocol-specific semantic queries quickly. After categorizing the addresses, we use the network aware clustering technique to group local DNS servers. By juxtaposing the DNS server clusters with clusters formed by Web clients obtained from a large portal Web site, we determine the distribution of identified DNS servers in busy clusters. A variety of applications are examined ranging from identifying suspected zombies to helping Content Distribution Networks in mapping location of DNS servers.

TI Do hornets have zombie workers?
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Colonies of the European hornet, Vespa crabro, are typically founded by a single queen mated to a single male. From the resulting colony relatedness pattern we predicted strong worker-queen conflict over male production where both the workers and the queen attempt to produce the colony's males. To test for this conflict, male production was studied in 15 hornet nests using a combination of DNA microsatellite analysis (282 males), worker ovary dissections (500 workers from eight nests) and 50 h of observation (four nests). In contrast to our prediction, the data show that hornet males are queens' sons, that workers never attempt to lay eggs, rarely have activated ovaries, and that there is no direct aggression between the queen and the workers. This contrasts with other data for vespine wasps, which support relatedness predictions. Dolichovespula arenaria has the same kin structure as V. crabro and workers produce males in many colonies. The similarity between these two species makes it difficult to explain why workers do not reproduce in V. crabro. Self-restraint is expected if worker reproduction significantly reduces colony productivity but there is no obvious reason why this should be important to V. crabro but not to D. arenaria. Alternatively, queen control may be important. The absence of expressed queen-worker conflict rules out physical control. Indirect pheromonal control is a possibility and is supported by the occurrence of royal courts and queen pheromone in Vespa but not Dolichovespula. Pheromonal queen control is considered evolutionarily unstable, but could result from a queen-worker arms race over reproductive control in which the queen is ahead. The genetic data also revealed diploid males in one colony, the first example in the vespine wasps, and two colonies with double matrilines, suggesting that occasional usurpation by spring queens occurs.

AB A distributed object system allows objects to be communicated from site to site disregarding their physical locations. Communicating objects often leaves a trail homing to the site that owns the original object. Short-cutting these trails reduces the number of "zombies" i.e., sites that are part of the trail but do not need the object for themselves. This paper proposes an algorithm that allows a site to disconnect gracefully that is, without global network synchronization. This algorithm focuses on the proper treatment of zombies.

TI The identification and characteristics of the partially dissociated
   states of patients with borderline personality disorder
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB A developmental and structural model of borderline personality disorder is described. Partial dissociation provoked by trauma and deprivation in childhood is seen to result in the persistence of separate self states. The characteristics of these and alternations between them are seen to account for the main features of the condition. The identification and characterization of states through clinical procedures and the use of the states grid are described and case illustrations are given. The states identified by the grid method in a series of 20 borderline patients are described and classified into six groups, named abuser rage, victim rage, passive victim, ideal, coping and zombie. The clinical value and nosological implications of the model and these findings are briefly discussed.

TI Dark Panopticon. Or, attack of the killer tomatoes
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE
AB In the wake of claims that much of critical human geography has succumbed to the dreaded postmodern fatigue syndrome-symptoms include unrelenting tiredness, uncritical social somnambulance, spectral hallucinations, an unnatural preoccupation with the dead, and a tendency to submit to passive and reactive forces-the authors offer a paper that came to them during a dream dreamt alongside insomnia. Borne of exhaustion rather than tiredness, the dream-work lends consistency to a host of fragments drawn from the milieux of spatial science, political economy, poststructuralist philosophy, postmodern sociology, twentieth-century literature, and popular culture. As a work composed in the dead of night, the authors follow Deleuze and Foucault in affirming not the omniscient light of Bentham's generalised, 'all-seeing' Panopticon, but the 'dark light' of the blind power lurking in the shadowy world of the Dark Panopticon. Surprisingly, the exemplary mise-en-sence for the resulting foray into the Heart of Darkness turns out to be the greengrocery that is invariably situated at the gateway to every supermarket and hypermarket. It is here that the authors sense the unbearable violence perpetrated against the flesh of the world-the flesh of soft fruit and animals, no less than the flesh of ourselves and the earth-and it is from here that the revenge of the zombie flesh takes hold (fetishistic depersonalisation and deindividuation). The authors argue that the human being is suspended, undone, and disseminated between the information society and the consumer society. Only our 'en-trails' are left amidst the flesh of the world. This undead dreamworld is less Orwellian than Kafkaesque: infinite suspense and perpetual regret.

TI Occult economies and the violence of abstraction: notes from the South
   African postcolony
SO AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST
AB Postcolonial South Africa, like other postrevolutionary societies, appears to have witnessed a dramatic rise in occult economies: in the deployment, real or imagined, of magical means for material ends. These embrace a wide range of phenomena, from "ritual murder," the sale of body parts, and the putative production of zombies to pyramid schemes and other financial seams. And they have led, in many places, to violent reactions against people accused of illicit accumulation. In the struggles that have ensued, the major lines of opposition have been not race or class but generation-mediated by gender. Why is all this occurring with such intensity, right now An answer to the question, and to the more genera I problem of making sense of the enchantments of modernity, is sought in the encounter of rural South Africa with the contradictory effects of millennial capitalism and the culture of neoliberalism. This encounter, goes the argument, brings "the global" and "the local"-treated here as analytic constructs rather than explanatory terms or empirical realities-into a dialectical interplay. It also has implications for the practice of anthropology, challenging us to do ethnography on an "awkward" scale, on planes that transect the here and now, then and there.

AB This paper falls into three parts. in Part 1 I give my reasons for rejecting two aspects of Horgan and Tienson's position as laid out in their book, the language of thought and belief-desire explanations of behaviour, while endorsing the connection they see between linguistic syntax and the syntax of a motor skill, in Part 2 1 outline the theory that the brain consists of two input-output transformation systems consciousness whose function is (a) to categorise problematic inputs, (b) to select a response appropriate to such inputs once they have been categorised and (c) to initiate and monitor the execution of such response once selected, and the "zombie-within" whose function is (a) to identify and alert consciousness to any inputs that are problematic and (b) either to ignore those that are non-problematic or route them to output as an automatic reflex. In Part 3 1 consider how far the properties of the two systems outlined in Part 2 can be understood in terms of the known properties of connectionist networks.

AB This paper discusses our implementation and experience with a camera-based whiteboard scanner. The ZombieBoard system (so called because it brings to electronic life the marks on a whiteboard) is built into both the physical environment and the information space, while augmenting and linking the two. Computer vision underlies two key technology components. First, image mosaicing is used to obtain high-resolution images of large surfaces using relatively low-resolution cameras. Second, real time activity analysis and line drawing analysis enable a Diagrammatic User Interface whereby commands are issued to the system by drawing on the whiteboard itself. The system has been in routine use at our research center for two years and has demonstrated the value of this approach to linking whiteboards with the electronic document world.

TI Computationalism is dead; now what? Response to Fetzer's 'Minds are not
   computers: (most) thought processes are not computational procedures'
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper I put Jim Fetter's esemplastic burial of the computational conception of mind within the context of both my own burial and the theory of mind I would put in place of this dead doctrine. My view in a nutshell: Computationalism will yield Total Turing Test-passing zombies (in the philosopher's sense of 'zombie'), but replicating persons will be unreachable for two reasons. Firstly, persons process information at a 'super'-Turing level; secondly, people enjoy certain properties (e.g. intentionality) beyond the reach of any mere information-processing object. Accordingly, computationalism ought to be supplanted with the engineering of 'subperson' artifacts and the irreducibly philosophical investigation of personhood. I end with nascent appraisal of Fetter's interesting semiotic/connectionist replacement for computationalism.

TI The use of psychostimulants in the pediatric patient
SO PEDIATRIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB The psychostimulant medications have the longest history of medical use in the treatment of childhood psychiatric conditions. Bradley(5) reported the first use of psychostimulant medications in children in 1938. He administered benzedrine (10-20 mg/day) to 30 children aged 5 to 14 years who were hospitalized because of severe behavior disorders. His description 60 years ago of the medication's action in these children is still familiar today:
   Probably the most striking change in behavior during the week of benzedrine therapy occurred in the school activities of many of these patients. Fourteen children responded in a spectacular fashion. Different teachers, reporting on these patients, who varied in age and school accomplishment, agreed that a great increase of interest in school material was noted immediately. There appeared a definite "drive" to accomplish as much as possible during the school period, and often to spend extra time completing additional work. Speed of comprehension and accuracy of performance were increased in most cases. Insight into school performance was generally present, though few of the children attributed it to the medication they had received earlier in the day. The improvement was noted in all school subjects. It appeared promptly the first day benzedrine was given and disappeared on the first day it was discontinued.(5)
   Barkley(2) reviewed the early research on psychostimulant drugs in hyperactive children, which by 1977 included many open and double-blind studies and involved hundreds of subjects. Between 1938 and 1974, 15 studies involving 915 children were performed, examining the effectiveness of methylphenidate for the control of hyperactivity. Seventy-seven percent of the subjects were judged to be improved when on methylphenidate. Similar rates of improvement were found for children treated with amphetamines (14 studies, 860 children) and pemoline (2 studies, 105 children). In the eight double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of the three types of psychostimulants, the mean improvement of hyperactive children on the placebo was only 39%. The effect size of psychostimulants can be calculated from such studies to be at approximately 1.0, the largest effect size of any of the psychotropic medications. Despite the long-time use of psychostimulants in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), several questions remain:
   Are all the psychostimulants interchangeable, or are some children selective responders to a particular psychostimulant? What data are available on Adderall, a mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine? Is it a useful addition to other agents for treating ADHD? What research has been done on other long-acting psychostimulants, such as the sustained-release (SR) methylphenidate (Ritalin-SR) or pemoline (Cylert)?
   What is the best way to dose psychostimulants? Is there a danger of raising the dose "too high" such that improved behavior in fact leads to a decrease in academic productivity (the so-called "zombie effect")?
   Is there any way to predict which children with ADHD are most likely torespond to psychostimulants?
   What side effects are encountered with psychostimulants? In particular, what is the risk for hepatic failure with pemoline? Can children with ADHD with ties be treated safely with psychostimulants? What are the latest data regarding the effects of psychostimulants on growth?
   The physician who manages children with ADI-ID must have a thorough understanding of all the issues involved in psychostimulant treatment.

TI Will zombies talk about consciousness? The paradox of phenomenal
   judgment: its implications for naturalistic dualism and other theories
   of mind
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB David Chalmers argues that a materialist theory of mind is in principle unattainable because consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical. In order to demonstrate this, he needs to make a convincing case for the conceptual possibility of zombies. His position, however, is rather tenuous due to the paradoxical nature of phenomenal judgments (among other things). That is, the fact that zombies would have to talk about consciousness and conscious experience may render them inconceivable. It is argued that this paradox is indeed fatal to his position, because zombies will never make meaningful phenomenal judgments.

AB In this paper, I argue that we should not ascribe beliefs and desires to subjects like zombies or (present day) computers which do not have phenomenal consciousness. In order to ascribe beliefs, we must distinguish between personal and subpersonal content. There may be states in my brain which represent the away of light intensities on my retina, but these states are not beliefs, because they are merely subpersonal. I argue that we cannot distinguish between personal and subpersonal content without reference to phenomenal consciousness. I argue for this by examining two attempts to account for belief without reference to phenomenal consciousness, functionalism and Dennett's patterns of behavior theory, and showing that they both fail. In the course of the arguments that these attempts fail, I develop some positive reasons for believing that phenomenal consciousness is indeed necessary.

TI The zebrafish early arrest mutants
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB This report describes mutants of the zebrafish having phenotypes causing a general arrest in early morphogenesis. These mutants identify a group of loci making up about 20% of the loci identified by mutants with visible morphological phenotypes within the first day of development. There are 12 Class I mutants, which fall into 5 complementation groups and have cells that lyse before morphological defects are observed. Mutants at three loci, speed bump, ogre and zombie, display abnormal nuclei. The 8 Class II mutants, which fall into 6 complementation groups, arrest development before cell lysis is observed. These mutants seemingly stop development in the late segmentation stages, and maintain a body shape similar to a 20 hour embryo.
   Mutations in speed bump, ogre, zombie, specter, poltergeist and troll were tested for cell lethality by transplanting mutant cells into wild-type hosts. With poltergeist, transplanted mutant cells all survive. The remainder of the mutants tested were autonomously but conditionally lethal: mutant cells, most of which lyse, sometimes survive to become notochord, muscles, or, in rare cases, large neurons, all cell types which become postmitotic in the gastrula. Some of the genes of the early arrest group may be necessary for progression though the cell cycle; if so, the survival of early differentiating cells may be based on having their terminal mitosis before the zygotic requirement for these genes.

We find that atomic diffusion of network formers occurs via a peroxy linkage defect whose concentration in the oxide changes under different processing conditions. From random walk theory it is possible then to calculate the resulting diffusion coefficients. These results are compared with measured diffusivities and empirical adjustments are made. Simulations of B diffusion were performed using the Athena and ZOMBIE simulators. A shell script interface was written to pre-process the Athena input file and modify the appropriate coefficients.

TI THE EFFECTS OF A VERTICAL CONTRACTION ON TURBULENCE DYNAMICS IN A STABLY
   STRATIFIED FLUID
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
AB We have experimentally studied the effects of mean strain on the evolution of stably stratified turbulence. Grid-generated turbulence (Re-lambda less than or equal to 25) in a stable linear mean background density gradient was passed through a two-dimensional contraction, contracting the stream only in the vertical direction. This induces an increase in stratification strength, which reduces the largest vertical overturning scales allowed by buoyancy forces. The mean strain through the contraction causes, on the other hand, stretching of streamwise vortices tending to increase the fluctuation levels of the transverse velocity components. This competition between buoyancy and vortex stretching dominates the turbulence dynamics inside and downstream of the contraction. Comparison between non-stratified and stratified experiments shows that the stratification significantly reduces the vertical velocity fluctuations. The vertical heat flux is initially enhanced through the contraction. Then, farther downstream the flux quickly reverses, leading to very strong restratification coinciding with an increase in the vertical velocity fluctuations. The vertical heat flux collapses much more rapidly than in the stratified case without an upstream contraction and the restratification intensity is also much stronger, showing values of normalized flux as strong as -0.55. Velocity spectra show that the revival of vertical velocity fluctuations, due to the strong restratification, starts at the very largest scales but is then subsequently transferred to smaller scales. The distance from the turbulence-generating grid to the entrance of the contraction is an important parameter which was varied in the experiments. The larger this distance, the larger the integral length scale can grow, approaching the limit set by buoyancy, before entering the contraction. The evolution of the various turbulence length scales is described. Two-point measurements of velocity and temperature transverse integral scales were also performed inside the contraction. The emergence of 'zombie' turbulence, for large buoyancy times, is in good quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations of Gerz & Yamazaki (1993) for stratification number larger than 1.

SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB We discuss two difficulties in the "directly skeptical" approach to inference in defeasible inheritance nets, as developed by Horty, Thomason and Touretzky.  We suggest that as a result of the general architecture of the approach, it is intrinsically unable to deal with a phenomenon of "floating conclusions", and has great difficulty in accommodating a phenomenon of "zombi paths".  The conclusion drawn is that the directly skeptical approach cannot hope to do the work of an approach via the family of all extensions.

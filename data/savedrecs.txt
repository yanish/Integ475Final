TI Zombies Go to Toronto: Zombifying Shame in Nab o Hopkinson's Brown Girl
   in the Ring
SO RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES
AB Caribbean-Canadian Nalo Hopkinson's speculative fiction novel Brown Girl in the Ring (1998) is set in a near future dystopian Toronto and contains many African and Caribbean supernatural and folkloric characters. This article focuses on the zombie, which traditionally functions as a symbol of powerlessness, and argues that Hopkinson's book expands the relations of power that this figure is commonly employed to probe. More specifically, the essay suggests that, in Brown Girl in the Ring, the zombie symbolizes black people's history of oppression, exploitation, and demonization. Furthermore, through reading the novel alongside emotion discourse and Vodou psychology, the article contends that the zombie in Hopkinson's book can be understood as being symbolic of the consequential shame that members of the African-Caribbean diaspora may experience from a legacy of oppression, which, significantly, includes internalizing a white Western perception of their African and Caribbean Cultural inheritance.

TI Neither Very Bi Nor Particularly Sexual: The Essence of the Bisexual in
   Young Adult Literature
SO CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION
AB This article examines four prominent young adult novels about bisexual protagonists: Julie Anne Peters's It's Our Prom (So Deal With It) (2012), Brent Hartinger's Double Feature: Attack of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies/Bride of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies (2007), Lili Wilkinson's Pink (2009), and Sara Ryan's Empress of the World (2001). Defining bisexuality in terms of gender-plural sexual desire, it argues that narratives about bisexuals may impose essentializing identities, which resignify and redefine bisexuality through the use of stereotypes and the evasion of the sexuality and plurality of bisexual desire. By doing this, Peters and Hartinger, who represent the ideological middle ground in such narratives, ironically sustain the invisibility of bisexuality that they ostensibly resist. Of the novels by Wilkinson and Ryan, Wilkinson's Pink is the most stereotypical and evasive example, while Ryan's Empress of the World, at the other extreme, manages to avoid essentializing bisexuality, seeing it in terms of plural desires. If narratives of bisexuality are to help bisexual teenagers interpret their plural desires and fill the bisexual spaces or gaps in their worlds, it is argued that this necessitates a shift towards approaches, like Ryan's, that recognize the variety and individuality of these teenagers.

TI You can run, you can hide: The epidemiology and statistical mechanics of
   zombies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We use a popular fictional disease, zombies, in order to introduce techniques used in modern epidemiology modeling, and ideas and techniques used in the numerical study of critical phenomena. We consider variants of zombie models, from fully connected continuous time dynamics to a full scale exact stochastic dynamic simulation of a zombie outbreak on the continental United States. Along the way, we offer a closed form analytical expression for the fully connected differential equation, and demonstrate that the single person per site two dimensional square lattice version of zombies lies in the percolation universality class. We end with a quantitative study of the full scale US outbreak, including the average susceptibility of different geographical regions.

TI Zombie Apocalypse: Can the Undead Teach the Living How to Survive an
   Emergency?
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
AB Objective. We examined whether or not CDC's zombie apocalypse campaign had the ability to achieve the agency's goals of educating young people about emergency preparedness and prompting them to get ready by developing an emergency kit and plan. While the campaign was extremely popular, we examined the question of whether the campaign had the capability to translate into knowledge and action.
   Methods. We conducted an online experiment with 340 undergraduate students divided randomly into two groups. One group was exposed to CDC's zombie blog post; the other to the same preparedness information presented in CDC's traditional, straightforward way. Participants then completed a survey designed to gauge their affective feelings, perceptions, retention of preparedness preparation, and intent to develop an emergency kit and plan.
   Results. While participants who viewed the humorous zombie material clearly enjoyed it, their positive affect did not lead to greater retention of preparedness information or greater expressed intent to prepare, compared with participants exposed to the factual treatment. The zombie approach had no influence on retention or resulted in less retention relative to the factual approach. Also, there was no significant between-group difference in reported likelihood of developing an emergency kit or plan.
   Conclusion. While the campaign drew unprecedented traffic to CDC's website, our findings suggest that it lacked the capability to fully achieve the agency's goals of educating people about preparedness and prompting them to get ready. This finding supports previous studies concluding that it is challenging to design public health messages that evoke positive affect as well as intended changes in intentions or behaviors.

TI Resource reallocation and zombie lending in Japan in the 1990s
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB We investigate how resources were reallocated in Japan during the 1990s, a decade of economic recession, by measuring aggregate productivity growth (APG) using plant-level data of manufacturers from 1981 to 2000. We find that the contribution to APG of resource reallocation deteriorated in the 1990s and became negative during the late 1990s, when a financial crisis occurred. Matched firm-plant data suggest that misdirected lending by banks to failing firms (zombie lending) allowed them to avoid reducing production inputs, especially labor. Our counter-factual analysis using a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous plants indicates that without zombie lending, annual APG would have been higher by one percentage point during the 1990s.

TI Brothers and Sisters in Arms: Intergroup Cooperation in a Violent
   Shooter Game Can Reduce Intergroup Bias
SO PSYCHOLOGY OF VIOLENCE
AB Objective: Video games increasingly have become multiplayer, and thus online video game players have the unique opportunity to cooperate with players from all over the world, including those who belong to different social groups. Consistent with research showing that intergroup cooperation leads to reductions in intergroup bias, playing a video game cooperatively with a member of a different social group (i.e., an outgroup member) may reduce bias. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to test whether playing a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup member reduces intergroup bias toward that partner's group. Method: In our investigation, Canadians (n = 138) played a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup (American) or ingroup member against alien (i.e., zombie-like) enemies. Results: Cooperating with an outgroup member in a violent context for only 12 minutes generated large reductions in outgroup prejudice. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential for even violent video games to serve as prejudice interventions.

TI A mechanism for graded, dynamically routable current propagation in
   pulse-gated synfire chains and implications for information coding
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Neural oscillations can enhance feature recognition (Azouz and Gray Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 97, 8110-8115 2000), modulate interactions between neurons (Womelsdorf et al. Science, 316, 1609-01612 2007), and improve learning and memory (Markowska et al. The Journal of Neuroscience, 15, 2063-2073 1995). Numerical studies have shown that coherent spiking can give rise to windows in time during which information transfer can be enhanced in neuronal networks (Abeles Israel Journal of Medical Sciences, 18, 83-92 1982; Lisman and Idiart Science, 267, 1512-1515 1995, Salinas and Sejnowski Nature Reviews. Neuroscience, 2, 539-550 2001). Unanswered questions are: 1) What is the transfer mechanism? And 2) how well can a transfer be executed? Here, we present a pulse-based mechanism by which a graded current amplitude may be exactly propagated from one neuronal population to another. The mechanism relies on the downstream gating of mean synaptic current amplitude from one population of neurons to another via a pulse. Because transfer is pulse-based, information may be dynamically routed through a neural circuit with fixed connectivity. We demonstrate the transfer mechanism in a realistic network of spiking neurons and show that it is robust to noise in the form of pulse timing inaccuracies, random synaptic strengths and finite size effects. We also show that the mechanism is structurally robust in that it may be implemented using biologically realistic pulses. The transfer mechanism may be used as a building block for fast, complex information processing in neural circuits. We show that the mechanism naturally leads to a framework wherein neural information coding and processing can be considered as a product of linear maps under the active control of a pulse generator. Distinct control and processing components combine to form the basis for the binding, propagation, and processing of dynamically routed information within neural pathways. Using our framework, we construct example neural circuits to 1) maintain a short-term memory, 2) compute time-windowed Fourier transforms, and 3) perform spatial rotations. We postulate that such circuits, with automatic and stereotyped control and processing of information, are the neural correlates of Crick and Koch's zombie modes.

TI Legitimation Crisis? On the Political Contradictions of Financialized
   Capitalism
SO Critical Historical Studies
AB Facade democracy. Post-democracy, Zombie democracy. De-democratization. In proliferating such terms, many observers posit that living through a "crisis of democracy," But what exactly is in crisis here? I argue that democracy's present travails are best understood as expressions, under historically specific contemporary conditions, of a general tendency to political crisis that is intrinsic to capitalist societies. I elaborate this thesis in three steps. First, I propose a general account of "the political contradiction of capitalism" as such, without reference to any particular historical form. Then, I reconstruct Jurgen Habermas's 1973 book, Legitimation Crisis, as an account of the form this political contradiction assumed in one specific phase of capitalist society, namely, the state-managed capitalism of the post World War 11 era. Finally, I sketch an account of democracy's current ills as expressions of capitalism's political contradiction in its present, financialized phase.

TI Conscious Vision in Action
SO COGNITIVE SCIENCE
AB It is natural to assume that the fine-grained and highly accurate spatial information present in visual experience is often used to guide our bodily actions. Yet this assumption has been challenged by proponents of the Two Visual Systems Hypothesis (TVSH), according to which visuomotor programming is the responsibility of a "zombie" processing stream whose sources of bottom-up spatial information are entirely non-conscious (Clark, 2007, 2009; Goodale & Milner, 1992, 2004a; Milner & Goodale, 1995/2006, 2008). In many formulations of TVSH, the role of conscious vision in action is limited to "recognizing objects, selecting targets for action, and determining what kinds of action, broadly speaking, to perform" (Clark, 2007, p. 570). Our aim in this study is to show that the available evidence not only fails to support this dichotomous view but actually reveals a significant role for conscious vision in motor programming, especially for actions that require deliberate attention.

SO JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
AB This article takes up the problem of unintentional sin in Psalms 19, 90, and 119 to ask what it was like to be a psalmist on the issue of moral agency. In contrast to some reconstructions of ancient Israelite (and Near Eastern) religion, I argue that concerns about intentionalityspecifically its lackindicate that the psalmists were not akin to philosophical zombies: what psalmists did mattered along with how they did it, with knowledge or without. I situate this psalmic way of being with reference to sin vis-a-vis Carol Newsom's work on moral agency in the Hebrew Bible, arguing that moral agency in the Psalms (at least on this matter) nuances some of the categories offered thus far.

TI Gene expression during zombie ant biting behavior reflects the
   complexity underlying fungal parasitic behavioral manipulation
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Adaptive manipulation of animal behavior by parasites functions to increase parasite transmission through changes in host behavior. These changes can range from slight alterations in existing behaviors of the host to the establishment of wholly novel behaviors. The biting behavior observed in Carpenter ants infected by the specialized fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis s.l. is an example of the latter. Though parasitic manipulation of host behavior is generally assumed to be due to the parasite's gene expression, few studies have set out to test this.
   Results: We experimentally infected Carpenter ants to collect tissue from both parasite and host during the time period when manipulated biting behavior is experienced. Upon observation of synchronized biting, samples were collected and subjected to mixed RNA-Seq analysis. We also sequenced and annotated the O. unilateralis s.l. genome as a reference for the fungal sequencing reads.
   Conclusions: Our mixed transcriptomics approach, together with a comparative genomics study, shows that the majority of the fungal genes that are up-regulated during manipulated biting behavior are unique to the O. unilateralis s.l. genome. This study furthermore reveals that the fungal parasite might be regulating immune- and neuronal stress responses in the host during manipulated biting, as well as impairing its chemosensory communication and causing apoptosis. Moreover, we found genes up-regulated during manipulation that putatively encode for proteins with reported effects on behavioral outputs, proteins involved in various neuropathologies and proteins involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids.

TI Apps for IMproving FITness and Increasing Physical Activity Among Young
   People: The AIMFIT Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Given the global prevalence of insufficient physical activity (PA), effective interventions that attenuate age-related decline in PA levels are needed. Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, their impact on PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and little is known about what makes a good mHealth app.
   Objective: The aim was to determine the effects of two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels.
   Methods: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14-17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8-week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed design and narrative. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1-mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps.
   Results: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n=17), nonimmersive app intervention (n=16), or the control group (n=18). The mean age of participants was 15.7 (SD 1.2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61%, 31/51) and 57% (29/51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96% (49/51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was -28.4 seconds shorter (95% CI -66.5 to 9.82, P=.20) for the immersive app group and -24.7 seconds (95% CI -63.5 to 14.2, P=.32) for the nonimmersive app group. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes.
   Conclusions: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity.

TI ZOMBIE VORTEX INSTABILITY. I. A PURELY HYDRODYNAMIC INSTABILITY TO
   RESURRECT THE DEAD ZONES OF PROTOPLANETARY DISKS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB There is considerable interest in hydrodynamic instabilities in dead zones of protoplanetary disks as a mechanism for driving angular momentum transport and as a source of particle-trapping vortices to mix chondrules and incubate planetesimal formation. We present simulations with a pseudo-spectral anelastic code and with the compressible code Athena, showing that stably stratified flows in a shearing, rotating box are violently unstable and produce space-filling, sustained turbulence dominated by large vortices with Rossby numbers of order similar to 0.2-0.3. This Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) is observed in both codes and is triggered by Kolmogorov turbulence with Mach numbers less than similar to 0.01. It is a common view that if a given constant density flow is stable, then stable vertical stratification should make the flow even more stable. Yet, we show that sufficient vertical stratification can be unstable to ZVI. ZVI is robust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions, or initial radial entropy or vortensity gradients (though we have studied ZVI only in the limit of infinite cooling time). The resolution of this paradox is that stable stratification allows for a new avenue to instability: baroclinic critical layers. ZVI has not been seen in previous studies of flows in rotating, shearing boxes because those calculations frequently lacked vertical density stratification and/ or sufficient numerical resolution. Although we do not expect appreciable angular momentum transport from ZVI in the small domains in this study, we hypothesize that ZVI in larger domains with compressible equations may lead to angular transport via spiral density waves.

TI Exergame Apps and Physical Activity: The Results of the ZOMBIE Trial
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
AB Background: Although there are thousands of health and fitness smartphone apps currently available, little research exists regarding the effects of mobile app technology on physical activity behavior. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test whether Exergame smartphone applications increase physical activity levels. Methods: This was a 12-week randomized, controlled, parallel group trial. The intervention consisted of the use of Exergame smartphone apps and motivational messaging. Validated instruments were used to measure physical activity, enjoyment, motivation, and competence. Results: Forty subjects were randomized and completed baseline assessments; 39 (97.5%) completed the 12-week follow-up. Median age was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR]=25, 41.75); 85% were women. No differences between groups were identified in primary or secondary outcomes. Within group, physical activity decreased in the controls and autonomous motivation increased in the intervention group. Discussion: Exploratory findings were interesting regarding the use of Exergames to encourage physical activity. The intervention group showed less of a decline in activity, suggesting a possible attenuation of the observed seasonal fluctuation by the use of the Exergames. Translation to Health Education Practice Given their popularity, health educators should continue to explore the use of Exergame apps as a tool to facilitate physical activity.

TI ZOMBIES AND PROBABILITY: A STOCHASTIC APPROACH TO THE DUALIST'S PROBLEMS
SO AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
AB This paper develops, for the purposes of answering some of the problems associated with interactionist dualism, a strategy suggested in the literature on libertarian free will in which non-physical mental events exploit physical indeterminism in effecting mind-body action. Three central points made in the paper, all of them to answer what would otherwise be an objection, are that (i) non-physical events that affect the probability of fundamental physical events do not necessarily conflict with the probabilities assigned by physical law; (ii) such interactions would in any case not show up in observations made purely at the physical level; and (iii) views of this kind fuse well with mainstream contemporary arguments for dualism that make use of the conceptual possibility of mind-body dissociation (e.g., zombie arguments). No development of the view for the libertarian is made or intended.

TI Living with antipsychotic medication side-effects: The experience of
   Australian mental health consumers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
AB The present study explores people's experience of living with antipsychotic medication side-effects. Qualitative data were gathered through semistructured interviews with 10 mental health consumers in a community care setting in Australia. The interview transcriptions were content analysed, and enhanced by combining manifest and latent content. Important contextual cues were identified through replaying the audio-recordings. Several main themes emerged from the analysis, including the impact of side-effects, attitudes to the use of medication and side-effects, and coping strategies to manage medication side-effects. Each participant reported between six and seven side-effects on average, which were often pronounced and had a major disruptive impact on their lives. Of these effects, the most commonly mentioned was sedation, which the participants described as leaving them in a 'zombie'-like state. Most participants expressed an attitude of acceptance about the side-effects. The participants' most common strategy to manage side-effects was to change the dosage of the medication. Other common side-effect management strategies involved using other medications to control side-effects, and diverse self-help techniques, the most common of which was relaxation/distraction techniques.

TI Conscious Control over Action
SO MIND & LANGUAGE
AB The extensive involvement of nonconscious processes in human behaviour has led some to suggest that consciousness is much less important for the control of action than we might think. In this article I push against this trend, developing an understanding of conscious control that is sensitive to our best models of overt (that is, bodily) action control. Further, I assess the cogency of various zombie challengeschallenges that seek to demote the importance of conscious control for human agency. I argue that though nonconscious contributions to action control are evidently robust, these challenges are overblown.

TI Hollywood's Haiti: Allegory, Crisis, and Intervention in The Serpent and
   the Rainbow and White Zombie
SO CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES
AB The first two republics in the Americas, the United States, and Haiti have a long, complicated history. Not surprisingly, the U.S./Haiti relationship has resulted in a large body of writing, both fiction and non-fiction. However, this cultural output has not extended to Hollywood, with very few films that have been set in Haiti. This essay explores how an allegorical reading of two of these films, Wes Craven's The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) and Victor Halperin's White Zombie (1932), enables new ways to think about Haiti's past, present, and future. Moreover, the essay considers the function of the "zombie" figure: born in Haiti and transformed in diverse times and contexts abroad, the contemporary cinematic zombie has been largely divorced for much of its life from its Haitian origins.

TI Antibacterial activity of silver-killed bacteria: the "zombies" effect
SO Scientific Reports
AB We report a previously unrecognized mechanism for the prolonged action of biocidal agents, which we denote as the ''zombies effect'': biocidally-killed bacteria are capable of killing living bacteria. The concept is demonstrated by first killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 with silver nitrate and then challenging, with the dead bacteria, a viable culture of the same bacterium: Efficient antibacterial activity of the killed bacteria is observed. A mechanism is suggested in terms of the action of the dead bacteria as a reservoir of silver, which, due to Le-Chatelier's principle, is re-targeted to the living bacteria. Langmuirian behavior, as well as deviations from it, support the proposed mechanism.

TI CDC's Use of Social Media and Humor in a Risk Campaign-"Preparedness
   101: Zombie Apocalypse"
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB This is a multiple methods study that highlights the tension between awareness- and behavioral-based campaign successes, particularly when communicating using social media and pop-culture-referencing humor. To illustrate, it examines the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) "zombie apocalypse" all-disaster-preparedness campaign. An interview with a CDC campaign manager, campaign document analysis, and a 2 (information form: social vs. traditional media) x 2 (message strategy: humorous vs. non-humorous) experiment uncovers benefits and pitfalls of using social media and humorous messaging for risk communication. Findings show social media can quickly spread information to new publics for minimal costs; however, experiment participants who received the humorous (i.e., zombie) risk message reported significantly weaker intentions to take protective actions in comparison to those who received the traditional, non-humorous risk message.

TI Human strategies for solving a time-place learning task: The role of
   counting and following verbal cues
SO BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB Two experiments were conducted to assess the emergence of time-place learning in humans. In experiment I, a computer based software was designed in which participants had to choose to enter one of four rooms in an abandoned house search for a zombie every 3-15 s. Zombies could be found in only one of these rooms every trial in 3 min periods during the 12 min sessions. After 4 training sessions, participants were exposed to a probe session in which zombies could be found in any room on every trial. Almost all participants behaved as if they were timing the availability intervals: they anticipated the changes in the location of the zombie and they persisted in their performance patterns during the probe session; however, verbal reports revealed that they were counting the number of trials in each period in order to decide when to switch between rooms. In the second experiment, the task was modified in two ways: counting was made harder by using three different intertrial ranges within each session: 2-6s, 2-11 s and 2-16 s. Second, labels were displaced during the final session to assess whether participants learned to click on a given place or to follow a set of verbal cues. We found that participants did not notice the label changes suggesting that they learned to click on a given place, and that a win/stay-lose/shift strategy was clearly used to decide when to switch rooms in the second experiment. The implications of verbal behavior when assessing time-place learning with humans and the possible differences in this process between humans and animals are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI How to Survive Cyberwar STEP ONE: Stop counting on others to protect you
SO SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN
AB CYBERSECURITY PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO TYPES of organizations those that have been hit and those that do not know it yet. Recent headlines should prove that this joke is largely true. Cybercriminals stole the credit-card information and personal data of millions of people from companies that included Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase. Security researchers discovered fundamental flaws in Internet building blocks, such as the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. A massive data-destruction attack sent Sony Pictures Entertainment back to using pen and paper. Criminals accessed the data of more than 80 million customers of health insurance giant Anthem. And these are just the incidents we know about.
   In the coming years, cyberattacks will almost certainly intensify, and that is a problem for all of us. Now that everyone is connected in some way to cyberspace through our phones, our laptops, our corporate networks we are all vulnerable. Hacked networks, servers, personal computers and online accounts are a basic resource for cybercriminals and government snoops alike. Your corporate network or personal gaming PC can easily become another tool in the arsenal of criminals or taxpayer-sponsored cyberspies. Compromised computers can be used as step-Ping-stones for the next attack or become part of a "botnet," a malicious network of controlled zombie devices rented out by the hour to launch denial-of-service attacks or distribute spam.
   In response to threats such as these, the natural reflex of governments in the U.S. and elsewhere is to militarize cyberspace, to attempt to police the digital world using centralized bureaucracies a:nd secret agencies. But this approach will never work. In fact, for reasons we will get to shortly, it might just make things worse. Cybersecurity is like a public health problem. Government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Con; trol and Prevention have important roles to play, but they cannot stop the spread of diseases on their own. They can only do their job if citizens do theirs.

TI An Evolutionary Classification of Genomic Function
SO GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB The pronouncements of the ENCODE Project Consortium regarding "junk DNA" exposed the need for an evolutionary classification of genomic elements according to their selected-effect function. In the classification scheme presented here, we divide the genome into "functional DNA," that is, DNA sequences that have a selected-effect function, and "rubbish DNA," that is, sequences that do not. Functional DNA is further subdivided into "literal DNA" and "indifferent DNA." In literal DNA, the order of nucleotides is under selection; in indifferent DNA, only the presence or absence of the sequence is under selection. Rubbish DNA is further subdivided into "junk DNA" and "garbage DNA." Junk DNA neither contributes to nor detracts from the fitness of the organism and, hence, evolves under selective neutrality. Garbage DNA, on the other hand, decreases the fitness of its carriers. Garbage DNA exists in the genome only because natural selection is neither omnipotent nor instantaneous. Each of these four functional categories can be 1) transcribed and translated, 2) transcribed but not translated, or 3) not transcribed. The affiliation of a DNA segment to a particular functional category may change during evolution: Functional DNA may become junk DNA, junk DNA may become garbage DNA, rubbish DNA may become functional DNA, and so on; however, determining the functionality or nonfunctionality of a genomic sequence must be based on its present status rather than on its potential to change (or not to change) in the future. Changes in functional affiliation are divided into pseudogenes, Lazarus DNA, zombie DNA, and Jekyll-to-Hyde DNA.

TI In the land of the living dead: a reflection on medical death criteria
   in The Walking Dead
SO ETHIK IN DER MEDIZIN
AB Definition of the problem Since its beginnings, the genre of the zombie film has been characterized by a cultural reflexive component, which critically accompanies political aberrations. Apart from this sociocritical tradition, the TV show The Walking Dead introduces a further level of reflection. Even though many aesthetic and narrative traditions of the zombie genre are taken up, the serial nature of the show allows a deeper view of the characters in the face of apocalyptic disintegration of personal, familial and social certainties, and normative structures. This uncertainty is most clearly illustrated in the dealing with death. Arguments The Walking Dead also reflects the increasing real dissolution of the certainty of death by the life sciences since the 1960s. In The Walking Dead, the characteristics and consequences of this discourse are sharpened dramatically in the form of a negation of biological certainties. Conclusion The series not only offers a critical-reflective medium to current discourse, but also adds new perspectives on death in society.

With this movie the cinema of the island becomes an important factor in the mapping of the undead, with a project that is both traditional and novel; at once horror film and politically charged black comedy. In this analysis of Juan of the Dead I take into account both classic zombie films - acknowledged as direct influences on Brugues's movie - as well as other Latin American films that have made use of the topic as a tool of social criticism.

Due to the unique characteristics of NAND flash memory, SSDs need to accurately understand the liveness of the data stored in themselves. Recently, the TRIM command has been introduced to notify SSDs of dead data caused by file deletions, which otherwise could not be tracked by SSDs. This paper goes one step further and proposes a new liveness state, called the zombie state, to denote live data that will be dead shortly due to the corresponding dirty data in the buffer cache. We also devise new zombie-aware garbage collection algorithms which utilize the information about such zombie data inside SSDs. To evaluate Zombie Chasing, we implement zombie-aware garbage collection algorithms in the prototype SSD and modify the Linux kernel and the Oracle DBMS to deliver the information on the zombie data to the prototype SSD. Through comprehensive evaluations using our in-house micro-benchmark and the TPC-C benchmark, we observe that Zombie Chasing improves SSD performance effectively by reducing garbage collection overhead. Especially, our evaluation with the TPC-C benchmark on the Oracle DBMS shows that Zombie Chasing enhances the Transactions Per Second (TPS) value by up to 22% with negligible overhead.

TI A South African Zombie Apocalypse: Lily Herne's Mall Rats Series
SO ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA
AB In 2011, Lily Herne published Deadlands, the first in her series of Mall Rats zombie novels for young adults. Deadlands was followed by Death of a Saint (2012) and Army of the Left (2013). The novels are set ten years after the zombie apocalypse, referred to as the War' by the characters, which took place during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Tournament in South Africa. The novels should be read within the context of a resurgence of zombie fiction in the USA and Europe after 2000. Described by Lauren Beukes as teen-fighting-zombie-fun', Herne's novels have all the makings of zombie fiction in global popular culture. In Herne's depiction of a South African zombie apocalypse, though, the zombies - except for the threat of contagion - are not the real enemy. They are pawns in a power struggle between the human survivors of the apocalypse and the Guardians, mysterious figures who seem to have appeared out of nowhere after the apocalypse. The way in which politics, power and witchcraft are intertwined in Herne's novels can therefore also be linked to the zombie discourse in postcolonial South Africa. Here, I explore whether Herne expresses a specific view in her novels on the role of authority in contemporary society.

TI Record of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato, the zombie-ant fungus,
   parasitizing Camponotus in an urban fragment of Atlantic Rainforest in
   southeastern Brazil
SO STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Ophiocordyceps is a fungal pathogen of ants of the tribe Camponotini. It is called zombie fungus, since it changes the host behavior, causing them to die in an exposed position, typically clinging onto and biting into the adaxial surface of shrub leaves. This study aimed to describe the occurrence of parasitic associations between Ophiocordyceps and ants of the genus Camponotus in an urban fragment of Atlantic Rainforest in southeastern Brazil and to measure the rate of hyperparasitism in Ophiocordyceps by other fungi in the same location. We found 57 individuals of four species of ants and three species of fungus. The age categories of fungi were equally distributed, and rate of hyperparasitism was 17.5% (n=10). The sampled area was recognized as an important site of Ophiocordyceps occurrence.

AB This paper reports on an introductory world regional geography course with a role-playing exercise. The goal was to situate students in a form of popular geopolitics that engaged them viscerally with positionality and othering. Students were assigned different positionalities in a liminal active learning environment within a context of fear of zombies; some actually engaged in othering or were othered; many vocally critiqued their own or others' positionalities and arguments. Later in the semester, students were more engaged and likely to apply the concepts of positionality and othering in critically thinking about the real-world case of Turkey's European Union application.

Floridi's method of levels of abstraction is applied to the relation between an ideal programmer and a modern computer seen together as an informational organism. The results obtained by the mental experiment known as the Knowledge Game are applied to this relation, so to explain what a programmer should know in order to program a modern computer. In particular, this analysis clearly shows why non-conscious agents have no hopes to write significant programs. Two main objections are then presented and attacked by corresponding counterobjections.

   Protests in the Americas
SO TEXT AND PERFORMANCE QUARTERLY
AB This essay analyzes the development of the relationship between performance and digital media within protest movements in the Americas. I track digital media's role in constituting what I call "performance constellations." Performance constellations complicate previous definitions of performance as acts of transfer in order to account for hybrid, networked, and decentered protest performances. Focusing on 1990s hacktivism within the Zapatista rebellion and on social media practices during the 2011 Chilean student protests, I demonstrate that by dis-locating bodies and events, performance constellations constitute important reworkings of time and space outside of neoliberal management.

TI Detection of Malware Propagation in Sensor Node and Botnet Group
   Clustering Based on E-mail Spam Analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Cyber incidents are increasing continuously. More than 200,000 new malicious codes appear, with more than 30,000 malicious codes distributed each day on average. These cyber attacks are expanding gradually to the social infrastructure (nuclear energy, power, water, etc.) and smart sensor networks. This paper proposes a method of detecting malware propagation in sensor Node and botnet clustering automatically by analyzing e-mails. More than 80% of spam e-mails are generated by the Node infected with malicious code, using various methods to avoid filtering such as direct-to-MX, fake Received header, and open relay vulnerability. This paper proposes a scheme that detects those types accurately, including a clustering method that targets the URL included in the e-mail body, e-mail subject, attached file, and hosting server, to detect the botnet group infected with the same malicious code. The proposed method recorded about 85% zombie IP detection rate when spam e-mails distributed in a commercial environment were analyzed. When applied to the portal site that delivers 10 million e-mails, the proposed technology is expected to detect at least 150,000 zombie Nodes each day. If advanced measures are taken against the detected zombie Nodes, the spread of cyber attack damages can apparently be reduced.

TI Undeath in Paradise: The Humanity of the Zombie in (Religious) Utopias
SO SIC-A JOURNAL OF LITERATURE CULTURE AND LITERARY TRANSLATION
AB The words 'utopia' and 'zombie' are likely to conjure up strong images in the mind of the reader. The first makes one think of perfection, of happiness, of something new and better; the other, of the monstrous, of death and decay. Despite the fact that these images are arguably the most common, one can question their validity: can it be said that utopias are always perfect, and are the undead always monstrous? In this paper, I aim to explore the concepts relating to both utopias and zombies and the possible connections between the two, including a reading of the undead in light of the ultimate utopia: Paradise. In the light of these analyses, I propose a more positive approach to the figure of the zombie, which will be discussed as a counterpoint to the commonly held views of (religious) utopias.

AB The process of acquiring a doctoral degree facilitates the transformational intellectual development of the degree candidate. This transformation in the candidate's thinking processes develop over a period of three to eight years. The candidate becomes familiar with the academic literature and then reasons about the research problem. The doctoral process facilitates the candidate to develop techniques that enable the candidate to logically solve problems in a more sophisticated manner, and conduct thought experiments. The candidate demonstrates the degree to which their intellect has developed by the writing of a dissertation. The dissertation is a written scholarly account of the candidate's rigorous research process, the findings and the original theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge. The written dissertation is evidence to the awarding university, other scholars and the broader community that the candidate has: mastered their subject, developed research insight, understands the 'rules and culture' of the discipline, has the ability to conduct independent research and is capable of communicating the findings to the community of scholars. In effect, the successful PhD is the admission ticket to the rigorous academic world. If the candidate uses questionable means to acquire the degree, the candidate does not get the required benefit of the intellectual development process. With increasing pressure on candidates to complete their degrees within a short time frame, some candidates are project managing the dissertation by outsourcing large aspects of the intellectual work, possible committing academic fraud. A doctoral dissertation that has been outsourced and then collated may be referred to as a zombie doctorate because the transformational intellectual process is unlikely to have occurred.

TI Enacting the apocalypse: Zombie metaphors in contemporary disaster
   preparedness
SO SOCIOLOGISK FORSKNING
AB Since the turn of the millennium, enactment of possible emergencies and catastrophes has become a most common way of producing knowledge about events yet to occur. Preparedness exercises are frequently performed by public authorities at local and regional levels. Collaborative approaches among relevant actors are enhanced and evaluated through simulated accidents and acts of terror as well as school shootings and epidemic outbreaks. Due to the incalculability of many modern threats, enactment is employed as a method for rendering potential future events available as empirical phenomena. However, sometimes these potential futures are represented in ways that correspond only to imagined and fictional worlds. The aim of this article is to explore the enactment of unreal possibilities in contemporary preparedness exercises. The empirical material employed for this purpose consists of crisis plans and exercise guides used in public and official institutions in the United States as well as qualitative interviews with municipal safety coordinators in Sweden.

TI Is Mereology a Guide to Conceivability?
SO MIND
AB Zombies are unconscious objects with conscious physical micro-duplicates. If zombies are possible then physicalism (the thesis that the physical determines the mental) is false. It has been argued that zombies are possible if conceivable for an agent with ideal rationality. At any rate, they are possible only if so conceivable. This essay uses a mereological constraint to highlight the fine-grained differences between actually conscious physical objects and certain of their actually consciousness-incapable proper parts. These mereological considerations form the basis of an argument by dilemma that zombies are inconceivable. Either an arbitrary actually conscious object might have had simpler consciousness-capable parts (and more complex consciousness-incapable parts) than it in fact has, or not. The affirmative horn leads to a version of panpsychism that is inconsistent with the ideal conceivability of zombies. The negative horn rules out zombies as incoherent. The upshot is a new reason to deny the conceivability of zombies.

TI Programming up to Congruence
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB This paper presents the design of ZOMBIE, a dependently-typed programming language that uses an adaptation of a congruence closure algorithm for proof and type inference. This algorithm allows the type checker to automatically use equality assumptions from the context when reasoning about equality. Most dependentlytyped languages automatically use equalities that follow from beta-reduction during type checking; however, such reasoning is incompatible with congruence closure. In contrast, ZOMBIE does not use automatic beta-reduction because types may contain potentially diverging terms. Therefore ZOMBIE provides a unique opportunity to explore an alternative definition of equivalence in dependentlytyped language design.
   Our work includes the specification of the language via a bidirectional type system, which works "up-to-congruence," and an algorithm for elaborating expressions in this language to an explicitly typed core language. We prove that our elaboration algorithm is complete with respect to the source type system, and always produces well typed terms in the core language. This algorithm has been implemented in the ZOMBIE language, which includes general recursion, irrelevant arguments, heterogeneous equality and datatypes.

AB What has been labelled New Horror' cinema has opened up its boundaries to incorporate signs specific to social and political events that accompanied and followed the events of 9/11. The reality of terror is transported into the fictional universe of horror. This article presents an interpretation of New Horror cinema using Yuri Lotman's theory of the semiosphere and Wilma Clark's extension of his theory in order to engage in a critical rethinking of how genres intersect with culture. The primary focus is on contemporary horror films that function as allegories that address post-9/11 and, in turn, to apply Lotman's theory of the semiosphere and the concept of cultural explosions' to account for the generic shifts that have transformed the structure of the horror genre.

An analysis of Casa de Lava reveals that this link to Tourneur's film is not just a tangential referential experience. As this article argues, I Walked with a Zombie was a central source in the working process of Casa de Lava, serving as a reference that was adapted constantly from the early stages of production, obeying to several production constraints and changes, which, although occasionally restrictive, also enriched the creative process.

TI PERCEPTUAL GUIDANCE
SO RATIO
AB Proponents of an intentionalist theory of perceptual experience have taken for granted that perceptual experience is an informing form of intentionality. Hence they often speak of the way an experience represents the environment to be, or what there is. In this respect perceptual experience is thus assumed to resemble a speech act like assertion or a mental state like belief. There is another important form of intentionality though that concerns not what there is, but what to do. I call this a guiding form of intentionality. In speech, there are - for example - imperatives and among intentional mental states there are desires and intentions. In this paper I argue that perceptual experience is at least sometimes characterized by such a guiding form of intentionality. Perception does not just inform, it is sometimes intrinsically action-guiding. I call this the perceptual guidance claim. I distinguish the perceptual guidance claim from related, but importantly distinct claims (such as claims concerning the perception of affordances or concerning whether perception is normative), and argue that perceptual action guidance occurs not just in an unconscious vision-for-action system, but also within conscious perceptual experience.

TI A novel method of mining network flow to detect P2P botnets
SO PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS
AB Botnets are a serious threat to cyber-security. As a consequence, botnet detection has become an important research topic in network protection and cyber-crime prevention. P2P botnets are one of the most malicious zombie networks, as their architecture imitates P2P software. Characteristics of P2P botnets include (1) the use of multiple controllers to avoid single-point failure; (2) the use of encryption to evade misuse detection technologies; and (3) the capacity to evade anomaly detection, usually by initiating numerous sessions without consuming substantial bandwidth. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel data mining method. First, we identify the differences between P2P botnet behavior and normal network behavior. Then, we use these differences to tune the data-mining parameters to cluster and distinguish normal Internet behavior from that lurking P2P botnets. This method can identify a P2P botnet without breaking the encryption. Furthermore, the detection system can be deployed without altering the existing network architecture, and it can detect the existence of botnets in a complex traffic mix before they attack. The experimental results reveal that the method is effective in recognizing the existence of botnets. Accordingly, the results of this study will be of value to information security academics and practitioners.

Invoking Ulrich Beck's discussion of zombie categories, we argue that while the appeal of 'multiculturalism' as a term has clearly declined, the category in Britain that it refers to encompasses not a single charter, but a series of political settlements and public policies that remain in place even though they have been joined (and frequently challenged) by others. Distinguishing between the term and the category is a valuable means of assessing the persistence of multiculturalism as a mode of integration in Britain.

TI Zombie bugs? The fungus Purpureocillium cf. lilacinum may manipulate the
   behavior of its host bug Edessa rufomarginata
SO MYCOLOGIA
AB Just before dying, Edessa rufomarginata (Hemiptera, Pentotomidae) individuals that are infected with the fungus Purpureocillium cf. lilacinum (Ascomycota: Ophiocordycipitaceae) move from the leaves onto the stems of their Solanum sp. host and firmly grasp the stems in ways seldom employed by uninfected bugs. These alterations in host behavior probably improve the chances that the subsequently produced fungal spores will be dispersed aerially. Purpureocillium cf. lilacinum is a member of the Ophiocordycipitaceae, a group in which other species also modify the behavior of their hosts. As in the case of newly distinguished relatives of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis associated with "zombie ants" the discovery of P. cf. lilacinum infecting bugs reveals that P. lilacinum may be more diverse than previously appreciated.

TI The walking dead and killing state: Zombification and the normalization
   of police violence
SO THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
AB In May 2012, police shot Rudy Eugene, a black man of Haitian decent, dead as he ate the face' of a homeless man on a deserted Miami causeway. Because of the strange gruesomeness of the attack and other similar violent acts, some in the media declared that a terrifying pandemicthe zombie apocalypse'had arrived. While this particular case may be yet another instance of mediated panic, we suggest cries of zombies' and cannibals' should not be dismissed as simply sensationalistic, irresponsible journalism. Rather, we see this case as a powerful example of the cultural production of a spectral sort of monstrosity that obscures and justifies police violence and state killing. As such, we argue that all of the contemporary zombie talk', usefully reveals how the logics of security, state violence and punitive disposability are imagined and reproduced as livable parts of late-capitalism.

   Concerning in-between bodies, zombie films have a unique vantage on miscegenation. Exploring earlier films alongside contemporary romantic comedies, it becomes clear that whereas earlier films shut down symbolic interracial fantasies, contemporary films do not. This isn't without problems, as some films still rescue zombies from zombiness (and hence, their blackness).

SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB Starting from the principle that the zombie apocalypse will probably not come with a rulebook, this introduction to the Zombies & Performance special issue of Studies in Theatre & Performance (co-edited by the author, Roberta Mock and Phil Smith) is offered as a sort of 'spotters guide'. Drawing upon the shifting representations of zombies within popular culture, this overview offers a sense of how the zombie has changed throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries to speak to the prevailing anxieties in any given moment. Positioning the zombie as a model of alterity, it considers how the various contributors to this special issue have negotiated the multiplicity inherent therein, as well as what the figure of the zombie might offer academics working in the field of performance studies.

TI 'This ain't no love-in, this ain't no happenin': Misfits, Detroit
   hardcore and the performance of zombie scenarios
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article explores the (ever changing) manifestation of the living dead as iconographic metaphor and performance scenario in Detroit's hardcore punk scene in the early 1980s. Focusing in particular on B-movie references by the Misfits, it will discuss how a shared transamerican vocabulary and image bank was used to respond to a national, cultural and economic landscape that played itself out in diverse ways on local and tribal levels. Here, low-budget atomic age zombie flicks of the 1950s and 1960s were made, as Dick Hebdige suggests they should, 'to mean and mean again' as a process of subcultural style. They hysterically re-performed the 'real' post-apocalyptic world of unemployment, fuel shortages, nuclear threat, curfews and pollution that was being portrayed contemporaneously in George Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978). Although it is commonly argued that zombies, like all monsters, are manifestations of 'collective nightmares', for hardcore punks hanging out in Detroit in the early 1980s the performance of zombie scenarios can be better understood as the theatricalization of lived experience and an attempt to work through the fluid relationships between roles and participants.

Each of these examples represents a paradigmatic shift in the construction and performance of Mexican national identity at their moment of creation. In a country where there has been a continuous and enormous effort to create a homogenous and stable national identity centred on the mestizo, the zombies examined in this article fracture hegemonic definitions and offer a variety of other(ed) ways of performing being Mexican.

Drawing on the idea that the living dead sub-genre provides the dominant vision of apocalypse in the present stage of capitalist development, the walks explore how real world referents of this fictional apocalypse are unfolding in everyday spaces. The article describes the assembling of a taxonomy of 'zombie spaces', drawing on a review of the fictional spaces of living dead film and literature, and how its categories are deployed on five performative walks in towns and cities in Devon (UK). It then discusses some of the findings from the walks, including new categories to add to the taxonomy, the illumination of real world 'apocalypse' at the level of the everyday, and reflections on how this category-driven performative walking might be developed in future.

TI Our encore: running from the Zombie 2.0
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article examines the relationship between running and the figure of the zombie, drawing from the author's experience of mobile augmented reality application Zombies Run! (2012). Acting as a combination of a mobile phone fitness application and radio play, Zombies Run! encourages the player to find a new reason to exercise, by aurally layering a zombie apocalypse over the real world. Beginning with a review of the evolutionary paradoxes that make running largely a biologically inefficient act for humans, the author explores the contentious figure of the running zombie (Zombie 2.0) and how it complicates humanity's ability to 'other' itself from the undead. Zombies Run! creates a space between fact and fiction that facilitates a mythogeographic perception of place and instances of paraludism. Here, the player is able to accept the rules of the fictional play world and the act of running lessens the ability to objectify the undead. To outrun the Zombie 2.0, humanity invariably runs towards the very thing they are fleeing from.

TI Eating Minds: fantasizing undead, becoming zombie in performance
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB Popular culture has developed an insatiable appetite for all things culinary and undead. Food and zombie studies, as distinct disciplines and areas of practice, intersect at the point of the mouth and via the act of eating. This article examines how food can be used to access the zombie in performance as a means to reconfigure the eating body. Through the discussion of a practice-as-research project that explored the eating zombie body through fantasy and food in performance, it proposes that new instances and representations of eating, feeding and their associated practices can be found in the image of the devouring undead. Deploying the zombie tropes of transformation and infection/affectation alongside Deleuze and Guattari's notion of becoming, it is argued that the eating body in performance can lead to aesthetic zombification - that is, the constructed act of fantasizing, playing and becoming zombie.

TI Performing things: from undeadliness to critical practice
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article plunders the indecipherable affects of undeadliness in order to map out a theoretical approach to some contemporary performance practices. By developing a notion of the performative through Julia Kristeva's speaking subject, the zombie figure in the film Pontypool is framed as an invocation of Thingness - a mute body lurking in the Real beyond language - an indecipherable material form, evacuated of its capacity to make sense. The zombie's evisceration of speech is then related to other modes of social and cultural performance. By analysing concert footage of Elvis Presley, a news report by Serene Branson and performances by Reggie Watts and Sue Tompkins, it is eventually proposed that Thingness might be extracted from the morbid conceit of zombie fiction, and rewritten instead as the symptom of a critically engaged practice.

For whatever reason, my pregnancy did not develop as hoped, and although the baby had died, my body refused to let go. This writing narrates a twice-told tale beset by a bi-fold body, where the zombie is folded and carried within its human counterpart.

AB Milner and Goodale's influential account of the primate cortical visual streams involves a division of consciousness between them, for it is the ventral stream that has the responsibility for visual consciousness. Hence, the dorsal visual stream is a 'zombie' stream. In this article, I argue that certain information carried by the dorsal stream likely plays a central role in the egocentric spatial content of experience, especially the experience of visual spatial constancy. Thus, the dorsal stream contributes to a pervasive feature of consciousness.

TI Stabilization of apoptotic cells: generation of zombie cells
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Apoptosis is characterized by degradation of cell components but plasma membrane remains intact. Apoptotic microtubule network (AMN) is organized during apoptosis forming a cortical structure beneath plasma membrane that maintains plasma membrane integrity. Apoptotic cells are also characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that can be potentially harmful for the cell. The aim of this study was to develop a method that allows stabilizing apoptotic cells for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. By using a cocktail composed of taxol (a microtubule stabilizer), Zn2+ (a caspase inhibitor) and coenzyme Q(10) (a lipid antioxidant), we were able to stabilize H460 apoptotic cells in cell cultures for at least 72 h, preventing secondary necrosis. Stabilized apoptotic cells maintain many apoptotic cell characteristics such as the presence of apoptotic microtubules, plasma membrane integrity, low intracellular calcium levels and mitochondrial polarization. Apoptotic cell stabilization may open new avenues in apoptosis detection and therapy.

TI The future of the European Union: A 'Hayekian' regime?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL THEORY
AB This article develops an assessment of the present-day European crisis management, referring to Wolfgang Streeck's recent interpretation of the European 'consolidation state' as an attempt to install a 'Hayekian' regime of liberalized transnational markets. This article arrives at a diagnosis different from Streeck's: if there has been a 'Hayekian' regime, it had already developed after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 and the subsequent dismantling of capital controls in the USA and Europe. As it appeared in the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the ultimate practical test of the Hayekian vision was dramatically negative. European crisis management, as it is still largely occupied with the imperative to maintain the solvency of troubled Euro states vis-a-vis the capital markets, is not following a Hayekian script. Rather, it is confronted with the challenge of removing the debris of the collapse of the former Hayekian regime, taking the form of zombie banks and large uncovered capital claims. Tomaster this challenge, not only intact European institutions and transnational cooperation in Europe would be required, but also much more democratic pressure from below.

TI Surviving at Any Cost: Guilt Expression Following Extreme Ethical
   Conflicts in a Virtual Setting
SO PLOS ONE
AB Studying human behavior in response to large-scale catastrophic events, particularly how moral challenges would be undertaken under extreme conditions, is an important preoccupation for contemporary scientists and decision leaders. However, researching this issue was hindered by the lack of readily available models. Immersive virtual worlds could represent a solution, by providing ways to test human behavior in controlled life-threatening situations. Using a massively multi-player zombie apocalypse setting, we analysed spontaneously reported feelings of guilt following ethically questionable actions related to survival. The occurrence and magnitude of guilt depended on the nature of the consequences of the action. Furthermore, feelings of guilt predicted long-lasting changes in behavior, displayed as compensatory actions. Finally, actions inflicting immediate harm to others appeared mostly prompted by panic and were more commonly regretted. Thus, extreme conditions trigger a reduction of the impact of ethical norms in decision making, although awareness of ethicality is retained to a surprising extent.

   Specter of Nostalgia in Zibahkhana
SO BIOSCOPE-SOUTH ASIAN SCREEN STUDIES
AB 2007 saw the release of the film Zibahkhana (dir. Omar Ali Khan), an independent production billed as Pakistan's first extreme horror film. Combining prominent nods to classic Hollywood horror films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Night of the Living Dead with plenty of references to Pakistani horror and action cinema, it foregrounds issues of social class, conflicting ideologies of Islam, globalization, and public sanitation. Featuring a vanload of privileged urban teenagers, a mob of zombie villagers, Pakistan's own Dracula, and a deranged family of killers including a large male figure in a burqa, film is not a simplistic critique of current socio-political issues in Pakistan; rather this article seeks to understand how its narrative and visual elements create powerful, temporal, and moral ambiguities that resist such superficial interpretation. Through a variety of narrative and visual techniques, Zibahkhana rejects simple dichotomies (e.g., Islamic radicalism versus kind and gentle Sufism) and instead uses blurred temporalities, fleeting allegorical moments, and the invocation of a rather ominous nostalgia to offer a sophisticated critique of the relationship between cinema and the nation-state.

TI Parasitic Manipulation of Hosts' Phenotype, or How to Make a Zombie-An
   Introduction to the Symposium
SO INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY
AB Nearly all animals in nature are infected by at least one parasite, and many of those parasites can significantly change the phenotype of their hosts, often in ways that increase the parasite's likelihood of transmission. Hosts' phenotypic changes are multidimensional, and manipulated traits include behavior, neurotransmission, coloration, morphology, and hormone levels. The field of parasitic manipulation of hosts' phenotype has now accrued many examples of systems where parasites manipulate the phenotypes of their hosts and focus has shifted to answering three main questions. First, through what mechanisms do parasites manipulate the hosts' phenotype? Parasites often induce changes in the hosts' phenotypes that neuroscientists are unable to recreate under laboratory conditions, suggesting that parasites may have much to teach us about links between the brain, immune system, and the expression of phenotype. Second, what are the ecological implications of phenotypic manipulation? Manipulated hosts are often abundant, and changes in their phenotype may have important population, community, and ecosystem-level implications. Finally, how did parasitic manipulation of hosts' phenotype evolve? The selective pressures faced by parasites are extremely complex, often with multiple hosts that are actively resisting infection, both in physiological and evolutionary time-scales. Here, we provide an overview of how the work presented in this special issue contributes to tackling these three main questions. Studies on parasites' manipulation of their hosts' phenotype are undertaken largely by parasitologists, and a major goal of this symposium is to recruit researchers from other fields to the study of these phenomena. Our ability to answer the three questions outlined above would be greatly enhanced by participation from individuals trained in the fields of, for example, neurobiology, physiology, immunology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and invertebrate biology. Conversely, because parasites that alter their hosts' phenotype are widespread, these fields will benefit from such study.

TI A Priori Conditionals and the Conceivability of Zombies
SO PHILOSOPHICAL PAPERS
AB The conditional analysis of phenomenal concepts, as proposed independently by Hawthorne (2002), Stalnaker (2002) and Braddon-Mitchell (2003), is used to undermine Chalmers's (1996) conceivability argument in a way that is compatible with our having the zombie intuition. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) To remove current misconceptions concerning how the analysis is to be applied. It will be explained how there are two distinct ways the analysis can be used to undermine the conceivability argument. (2) To employ this exposition to defend the analysis from objections leveled against it by Chalmers (2005) and Alter (2007).

TI Suspended Animation: Attuning to Material-Discursive Data and Attending
   via Poesis During Somatographic Inquiry
SO QUALITATIVE INQUIRY
AB What possibilities for thinking and expression lie suspended between what we say is a "something" or a "someone" and the forces, multiplicities, intensities, and uncanny relations that effect and constitute its naming-its sedimentation as such? How do we engage in analysis practices that help hold open identitarian thought's press so that we might learn from the embodied register of previously un-thought forces and creative rhythms; the material-discursive passageways of a life becoming a life? In this essay, the author introduces somatographic analysis as a practice of deeply attuning and attending via poesis, or creativity, to material-discursive data and the subjective emergences they enact. Following a description of somatographic analyses' practical features and aims, a Working-Class Academic Zombie as figuration gets assembled. This figuration functions as both an illustration of somatographic analysis practices irrupting in the fold of inquiry and an alternative material-theoretical tool marking the limits of classificatory systems for understanding first-generation college students and their paths to becoming women academics.

TI ConnectionScore: a statistical technique to resist application-layer
   DDoS attacks
SO JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
AB In an application-layer distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, zombie machines send a large number of legitimate requests to the victim server. Since these requests have legitimate formats and are sent through normal TCP connections, intrusion detection systems cannot detect them. In these attacks, an adversary does not saturate the bandwidth of the victim server through inbound traffic, but through outbound traffic. The next aim of the adversary is to consume and exhaust computational resources (e.g., CPU cycles), memory resources, TCP/IP stack, resources of input/output devices, etc. This paper proposes a novel scheme which is called ConnectionScore to resist such DDoS attacks. During the attack time, any connection is scored based on history and statistical analysis which has been done during the normal condition. The bottleneck resources are retaken from those connections which take lower scores. Our analysis shows that connections established by the adversary give low scores. In fact, the ConnectionScore technique can estimate legitimacy of connections with high probability. The rate of suspicious connections being dropped is adjusted based on the current level of overload of the server and a threshold-level of free resources. To evaluate the performance of the scheme, we perform experiments in the Emulab environment using real traceroute data of the ClarkNet WWW server (http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/ClarkNet-HTTP.html).

TI From the Phenomenology to the Mechanisms of Consciousness: Integrated
   Information Theory 3.0
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0, which incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological axioms: information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to non-interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as "differences that make a difference" within a system, and integrated information as information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information Phi(Max) its quantity. From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true "zombies" - unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious complexes.

TI Can the ZoMBieS method be used to characterise scintillator
   non-linearity?
SO APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES
AB Measurements of the detection efficiency as a function of deposited electron energy in a liquid scintillation cocktail between 4 key and 49 keV are obtained using the ZoMBieS method. Comparison is made between the measured data and the Poisson-Birks detection efficiency model. Measurements of the Birks non-linearity parameter, kB, and the linearised scintillation response of each photomultiplier, omega(i), were made using these data. However, the value of kB that best linearises the scintillator response is found to vary depending upon which photomultiplier is used in its determination, and the measured kB and omega(i); vary depending on the external source geometry. The cause of this behaviour is unknown. The triple-coincident detection efficiency appears to be unaffected by any systematic errors. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI In search of 'intergenerational cultures of worklessness': Hunting the
   Yeti and shooting zombies
SO CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY
AB The idea of 'intergenerational cultures of worklessness' has become influential in UK politics and policy, and been used to explain contemporary worklessness and to justify welfare reforms. Workless parents are said to pass on to their children attitudes and behaviours which inculcate 'welfare dependency'. In its strongest version, politicians and welfare practitioners talk confidently of 'three generations of families where no-one has ever worked'; even though no study, bar this one, has investigated whether such families actually exist. Solid evidence for intergenerational cultures of worklessness is elusive so this study tested the idea via interviews with twenty families in Glasgow and Middlesbrough that had been long-term workless. Theories of intergenerational cultures of worklessness feel like 'zombie arguments' - resistant to evidence and social scientific efforts to kill them off. Regardless, the findings of this critical case study are offered as a fresh batch of ammunition with which to try to do so.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
AB The aim of this learning exercise was to harness current interest in zombies in order to educate audiences about the epidemiology of infectious disease. Participants in the activity were provided with an outbreak scenario, which they then used as the basis of play-based activities. By considering the mode and speed of transmission, size of outbreak and prevention/control strategy, participant groups were able to define parameters of their outbreak scenario. These were then input to SimZombie, a computer simulation program developed by the authors, which visually demonstrated the spread of infection through a population. The resulting animations were then used as the basis of in-depth discussion which, in turn, enabled the consideration of principles of disease transmission and control strategies. The activity provided an opportunity to engage a range of audiences through a variety of different delivery mechanisms, including role play, workshops and informal drop-in. Learning was evidenced by participation and feedback.

TI Cycling's Sensory Strategies: How Cyclists Mediate their Exposure to the
   Urban Environment
SO MOBILITIES
AB In this article, we focus on the many ways cyclists mediate their sensory exposure to the urban environment. Drawing on research in Hull, Hackney and Bristol during 2010 and 2011 for the Cycling Cultures research project, we describe a range of 'sensory strategies' enrolled by cyclists. Our research reveals how sensory strategies, such as using mobile audio devices, involve deliberate and finely tuned practices shaped by factors such as relaxation, motivation and location. This presents a contrast to media representations of the 'iPod zombie cyclist' who, plugged into a mobile audio device, lumbers insensitively and dangerously through the urban landscape. The article complicates the idea that sensory practices of listening and not-listening are two fixed and distinct ways of being in the urban environment. We suggest that considering the sensory strategies of cyclists opens up a new terrain for thinking about less easily represented, uncertain and fleeting intersections of mobility, place and the senses. Ultimately, we argue that an analysis of cycling's sensory strategies might enrich our understanding of mobility cultures by operating to reconnect a range of mobile citizens with the broader messy and less easily controllable sensory landscape. This has implications both for understanding cycling as a sensory practice and for thinking about how the sensory dimensions of other mobile practices are shaped by practitioners.

SO SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
AB How do individuals who switch between opposing sides develop a sense of commitment to their new groups? Study 1 examined these dynamics in a live-action tag game known as Humans versus Zombies, in which players transitioned from being Human to being Zombie, thus turning against their former fellow Humans. Study 2 examined data from professional basketball players in the National Basketball Association who moved to a new team and had to play against their former team. Aggressive acts against former group members in these competitive settings determined commitment to the new group above and beyond other factors. Aggressive acts against former teammates, such as simulated killing (Study 1) and blocked shots (Study 2), promoted more positive self-reported attitudes toward the new group (Study 1) and more collaboration with new group members in the form of assists (Study 2).

TI Phytoplasma Effector SAP54 Hijacks Plant Reproduction by Degrading
   MADS-box Proteins and Promotes Insect Colonization in a RAD23-Dependent
   Manner
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Pathogens that rely upon multiple hosts to complete their life cycles often modify behavior and development of these hosts to coerce them into improving pathogen fitness. However, few studies describe mechanisms underlying host coercion. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism by which an insect-transmitted pathogen of plants alters floral development to convert flowers into vegetative tissues. We find that phytoplasma produce a novel effector protein (SAP54) that interacts with members of the MADS-domain transcription factor (MTF) family, including key regulators SEPALLATA3 and APETALA1, that occupy central positions in the regulation of floral development. SAP54 mediates degradation of MTFs by interacting with proteins of the RADIATION SENSITIVE23 (RAD23) family, eukaryotic proteins that shuttle substrates to the proteasome. Arabidopsis rad23 mutants do not show conversion of flowers into leaf-like tissues in the presence of SAP54 and during phytoplasma infection, emphasizing the importance of RAD23 to the activity of SAP54. Remarkably, plants with SAP54-induced leaf-like flowers are more attractive for colonization by phytoplasma leafhopper vectors and this colonization preference is dependent on RAD23. An effector that targets and suppresses flowering while simultaneously promoting insect herbivore colonization is unprecedented. Moreover, RAD23 proteins have, to our knowledge, no known roles in flower development, nor plant defence mechanisms against insects. Thus SAP54 generates a short circuit between two key pathways of the host to alter development, resulting in sterile plants, and promotes attractiveness of these plants to leafhopper vectors helping the obligate phytoplasmas reproduce and propagate (zombie plants).
   Author Summary Parasites that colonize multiple hosts often coerce these hosts into improving their own survival and reproduction rates. However, how parasites do this is largely unknown. Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant parasites that require sap-feeding insect vectorsleafhoppersfor their propagation and dispersal. It has been known for a long time that phytoplasmas stimulate dramatic developmental changes in a broad range of plant species, such as the conversion of flowers into leaves known as phyllody and the proliferation of stems known as witches' broom. Here we report how and why phytoplasmas cause these dramatic developmental changes. We identified a phytoplasma virulence protein, SAP54, which transforms flowers into leaves and converts plants into more attractive hosts for the egg-laying and reproduction of their leafhopper vectors. We show that SAP54 exerts its effect by promoting the degradation of proteins that regulate important developmental processes in flowering plants. These proteins are highly conserved transcription factors of the MADS-box family, and reducing their activity through SAP54-mediated degradation curtails flower development, generating sterile plants. This degradation process requires RAD23, a protein that recruits the transcription factors to the protein degradation machinery. The resulting sterile plants, which form leaves in place of flowers, are more attractive to leafhoppers, arguably making phytoplasmas master manipulators of the parasite world.

   dopamine D1/D2 receptors
SO AUSTRALASIAN PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: While side effects of stimulant medication used to treat children for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have been clinically described as mild but variable, there is little or no research or understanding of biological mechanisms involved.
   Method: The present short review extends the tonic-phasic' dopamine hypothesis in terms of prefrontal and subcortical dopamine receptor (D1/D2) imbalance.
   Results: The minor allele of the dopamine D1 receptor predicts the zombie-like' motor side effect clinically described in some children treated with stimulant medications.
   Conclusion: Stimulant side effects may be best understood as reflecting imbalance in parallel cortico-thalamic-striatal circuits, and motor side effects as a result of prefrontal D1/D2 imbalance allowing greater motor inhibitory effects at subcortical D2 receptors. This is a variation of the tonic-phasic' hypothesis, which takes D1 allelic variation into account.

TI Zombie Law: Conjugality, Annulment, and the (Married) Living Dead
SO FEMINIST LEGAL STUDIES
AB This article deploys and extends Ulrich Beck's critique of 'zombie categories' (Beck in J Consum Cult 1 (2):261-277, 2001) to consider how conjugal relationships are brought into being before the law. The argument presented here is that sexual performatives relating to marriage-and especially, in this instance, consummation-continue to produce a kind of social-legal magic, even as the social flesh of their enactment is rotting. Rules concerning annulment relating to wedding ceremonies, consent, disclosure, and consummation demonstrate that certain frameworks of conjugality involve a kind of corporeal magic animating the privileged place of heterosexual marriage. Thus, rules and regulations pertaining to weddings continue to produce and protect heterogendered, sexually dimorphous bodies, even though this privileging is-or at least, is becoming-socially obsolete.

However, if we take intentions, beliefs, or mental representations all to instantiate some mental properties, then the more basic issue regarding such collective engagements is what it is for groups of individual minds to share a mind. Somewhat surprisingly, this very issue has not received much attention in the respective debates and when it has, typically the outlook has been skeptical or outright negative. In this paper, I argue that it is epistemologically possible for a group of individuals to literally share a single mental unit. In particular, I will put forward and defend what I shall call the zombie conception of group minds.

TI Preventing Zombie Lending
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB Because of limited liability, insolvent banks have an incentive to continue lending to insolvent borrowers, in order to hide losses and gamble for resurrection, even though this is socially inefficient. We suggest a scheme that regulators could use to solve this problem. The scheme would induce banks to reveal their bad loans, which can then be dealt with. Bank participation in the scheme would be voluntary. Even though banks have private information on the quantity of bad loans on their balance sheets, the scheme avoids creating windfall gains for bank equity holders. In addition, some losses can be imposed on debt holders.

TI Sensory Arsenal on the Stinger of the Parasitoid Jewel Wasp and Its
   Possible Role in Identifying Cockroach Brains
SO PLOS ONE
AB The parasitoid jewel wasp uses cockroaches as live food supply for its developing larva. To this end, the adult wasp stings a cockroach and injects venom directly inside its brain, turning the prey into a submissive 'zombie'. Here, we characterize the sensory arsenal on the wasp's stinger that enables the wasp to identify the brain target inside the cockroach's head. An electron microscopy study of the stinger reveals (a) cuticular depressions innervated by a single mechanosensory neuron, which are presumably campaniform sensilla; and (b) dome-shaped structures innervated by a single mechanosensory neuron and 4-5 chemosensory neurons, which are presumably contact-chemoreceptive sensilla. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings from stinger afferents show increased firing rate in response to mechanical stimulation with agarose. This response is direction-selective and depends upon the concentration (density) of the agarose, such that the most robust response is evoked when the stinger is stimulated in the distal-to-proximal direction (concomitant with the penetration during the natural stinging behavior) and penetrating into relatively hard (0.75%-2.5%) agarose pellets. Accordingly, wasps demonstrate a normal stinging behavior when presented with cockroaches in which the brain was replaced with a hard (2.5%) agarose pellet. Conversely, wasps demonstrate a prolonged stinging behavior when the cockroach brain was either removed or replaced by a soft (0.5%) agarose pellet, or when stinger sensory organs were ablated prior to stinging. We conclude that the parasitoid jewel wasp uses at least mechanosensory inputs from its stinger to identify the brain within the head capsule of the cockroach prey.

TI Conceivability and Coherence: A Skeptical View of Zombies
SO ERKENNTNIS
AB One reason for the recent attention to conceivability claims is to be found in the extended use of conceivability in philosophy of mind, and then especially in connection with zombie thought experiments. The idea is that zombies are conceivable; beings that look like us and behave like us in all ways, but for which "all is dark inside;" that is, for a zombie, there is no "what it is like." There is no "what it is like" to be a zombie, there is no "what it is like" for a zombie to feel pain, there is no "what it is like" for a zombie to taste, or feel, or smell something. They are creatures without consciousness. I am skeptical about the conceivability of zombies. That is not to say that I believe that there is some inherent contradiction to be found in the idea of zombies. Instead, I do not think that I am justified in believing that zombies are conceivable. The focus on justification is not common in the literature on conceivability, or for that matter in the literature on the possibility of zombies. Instead, the focus tends to be on trying to find out whether or not the notion of a zombie is contradictory. It is widely accepted in the literature on conceivability that the absence of a contradiction when conceiving of X is both necessary and sufficient for X to be conceivable. That might be true of ideal conceivability, but as I will argue below, ideal conceivability is not relevant to our (human) pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Further, as I will argue, once we focus on non-ideal conceivability the notion of justification, and degrees of justification comes into play.

TI 'Zombies ahead!' A study of how hacked digital road signs destabilize
   the physical space of roadways
SO VISUAL COMMUNICATION
AB This article explores some of the ways in which hacked Changeable Message Signs (CMSs) destabilize the physical space of motor transport spaces and jeopardize the institutionalized function of travel. While CMSs draw attention to the correlation between motorists' current positions, possible inconveniences ahead and their final destination, hacked CMSs and the subsequent projection of unsanctioned messages destabilize this correlation. Hence, the seemingly straightforward relationship between motor transport spaces and the activities of motorists, pedestrians and passers-by is in fact fashioned by the particular kind of message that is displayed at any given moment. Focusing on the spatial effects of hacked CMSs and how the dissemination of unsanctioned information points to the social stratifications of motor transport spaces, hacking is understood as a means of combating the disciplinary regimes of roadways.

TI Detecting mobile malware threats to homeland security through static
   analysis
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB Recent years have seen the significant increase in the popularity of smartphones. This popularity has been accompanied with an equally alarming rise in mobile malware. Recently released mobile malware targeting Android devices have been found to specifically focus on root exploits to obtain root-level access and execute instructions from a remote server. Thus, this kind of mobile malware presents a significant threat to Homeland Security. This is possible because smartphones can serve as zombie devices which are then controlled by hackers' via a C&C server. In this paper, we discuss the defining characteristics inherent in mobile malware and show mobile attack scenarios which are feasible against Homeland Security. We also propose a static analysis tool, DroidAnalyzer, which identifies potential vulnerabilities of Android apps and the presence of root exploits. Then, we analyze various mobile malware samples and targeting apps such as banking, flight tracking and booking, home&office monitoring apps to examine potential vulnerabilities by applying DroidAnalyzer.

TI Thoughtlessness and resentment: Determinism and moral responsibility in
   the case of Adolf Eichmann
SO PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL CRITICISM
AB Is a devoted Nazi or a zombie bureaucrat a greater moral and political problem? Because the dangers of immoral fanaticism are so clear, the dangers of mindless bureaucracy are easy to overlook. Yet zombie bureaucrats have contributed substantially to the greatest catastrophes of the 20th century, doing so seemingly oblivious to the monstrous qualities of their actions. Hannah Arendt's work on thoughtlessness raises a dilemma: if Eichmann, the architect of the Nazi Final Solution, truly was a thoughtless 'cog', lacking in intentionality, can one really hold him morally accountable for the evil qualities of his acts? This article relates Arendt's 'thought' and Strawson's and Bilgrami's discussion of 'reactive attitudes' and Sartre's concept of 'bad faith'. To find a basis for moral accountable in seemingly thoughtless cases like Eichmann's. Although Arendt's Eichmann is an extreme example, finding a basis to hold him accountable is valuable because 'little Eichmanns' will persist as long as impersonal forces structure and depress reactive attitudes.

AB The advent of cloud computing has given a provision for both good and malicious opportunities. Virtualization itself as a component of Cloud computing, has provided users with an immediate way of accessing limitless resource infrastructures. Botnets have evolved to be the most dangerous group of remote-operated zombie computers given the open cloud environment. They happen to be the dark side of computing due to the ability to run illegal activities through remote installations, attacks and propagations through exploiting vulnerabilities. The problem that this paper addresses is that botnet technology is advancing each day and detection in the cloud is becoming hard. In this paper, therefore, the authors' presents an approach for detecting an infection of a robot network in the cloud environment. The authors proposed a detection mechanism using Artificial Immune System (AIS). The results show that this research is significant.

AB While Phase Change Memory (PCM) has emerged as one of most promising complements or even replacements of DRAM-based memory, it has only limited write endurance. Because of uneven write distribution, PCM is highly likely to have early failures, which can spread over the chip space and leave the entire chip unusable. Wear leveling is an indispensable technique to even out wear caused by the writes. However, because of process variation early failure cannot be fully avoided. State-of-the-art wear-leveling schemes, such as Start-Gap and Security Refresh, cease to function once even a single block failure occurs because their designs require persistent writable address space for wear leveling operations. Existent solutions attempting to address the problem demand substantial OS supports, such as explicit space allocations and data migrations. The demand on substantial OS cooperation creates a barrier to widespread adoption of the PCM technique.
   While fault-tolerance techniques, such as FREE-p and zombie, that remap failed blocks to inaccessible but healthy space have the potential to address the wear-leveling issue by relocating data from failed blocks to healthy ones, they cannot work together with the wear-leveling schemes as data migration may change placement of relocated data. In this paper, we propose a framework, WL-Reviver, that allows any in-PCM wear-leveling scheme to keep delivering its designed leveling service even after failures occur in its working address space. The design is unique on two aspects: (1) it leverages the fault-tolerance techniques so that they can work together with the wear-leveling schemes; and (2) it requires no OS supports additional to what're available to today's DRAM-based memory system. Furthermore, WL-Reviver is a lightweight framework of very low overhead. Our extensive experiments show that WL-Reviver can efficiently revive a wear-leveling scheme without compromising the scheme's wear-leveling effect.

AB Spammers are one of the key security related threat on the Internet nowadays. Attackers can recruit a large number of machines at economic intensive through spamming. Spain zombies are compromised machines in a network which are involved in the spamming activities. Spammers use spam zombies to perform cyber crimes. Spamming causes wastage of network bandwidth. So it is a significant challenge for system administrators to identify and block the spammers in a network. The existing spam zombie detections algorithms are PT(Percentage Threshold), CT(Count Threshold) and SPOT. This paper shows comparison of these spank zombie detection algorithms. The result shows that SPOT gives good result as compared to PT and CT. The proposed system assists system administrators to automatically detect the spammers in their networks in an online manner. For spammer detection the system uses a SPOT detection algorithm which is based on a statistical tool known as Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The experimental results shows that the SPOT detection algorithm detects the spammers very effectively. The system blocks the spammers and user can reactivate their account by passing a security test. The system also detects and deletes emails with virus files in the attachments. The proposed system focuses only on detection of spammers and not the prevention.

AB User interaction is one of the most important features of online social networks, and is the basis of research of user behavior analysis, information spreading model, etc. However, existing approaches focus on the interactions between adjacent nodes, which do not fully take the interactions and relationship between local region users into consideration as well as the details of interaction process. In this paper, we find that there exists influence transfer effect in the process of user interactions, and present a regional user interaction model to analyze and understand interactions between users in a local region by influence transfer effect. Based on real data from Sina Weibo, we validate the effectiveness of our model by the experiments of user type classification, influential user identification and zombie user identification in online social networks. The experimental results show that our model present better performance than the PageRank based method and machine learning method.

AB The Domain Name System (DNS) is an Internetwide, hierarchical naming system used to translate domain names into numeric IP addresses. Any disruption of DNS service can have serious consequences. We present a formal game-theoretic analysis of a notable threat to DNS, namely the bandwidth amplification attack (BAA), and the countermeasures designed to defend against it. We model the DNS BAA as a two-player, turn-based, zero-sum stochastic game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker attempts to flood a victim DNS server with malicious traffic by choosing an appropriate number of zombie machines with which to attack. In response, the defender chooses among five BAA countermeasures, each of which seeks to increase the amount of legitimate traffic the victim server processes. To simplify the model and optimize the analysis, our model does not explicitly track the handling of each packet. Instead, our model is based on calculations of the rates at which the relevant kinds of events occur in each state. We use our game-based model of DNS BAA to generate optimal attack strategies, which vary the number of zombies, and optimal defense strategies, which aim to enhance the utility of the BAA countermeasures by combining them in advantageous ways. The goal of these strategies is to optimize the attacker's and defender's payoffs, which are defined using probabilistic reward-based properties, and are measured in terms of the attacker's ability to minimize the volume of legitimate traffic that is processed, and the defender's ability to maximize the volume of legitimate traffic that is processed.

AB WHOIS acts as a registry for organisations or individuals who "own" or take responsibility for domains. For any registry to be functional, its integrity needs to be assured. Unfortunately, WHOIS data does not appear to meet basic integrity requirements in many cases, reducing the effectiveness of law enforcement and rightsholders in requesting takedowns for phishing kits, zombie hosts that are part of a botnet, or infringing content. In this paper, we illustrate the problem using a case study from trademark protection, where investigators attempt to trace fake goods being advertised on Facebook. The results indicate that ICANN needs to at least introduce minimum verification standards for WHOIS records vis-a-vis integrity, and optimally, develop a system for rapid takedowns in the event that a domain is being misused.

Only recently a new, fruitful area of research on the behaviour of masses of zombies has been investigated.
   In this paper, we focus on modeling the behaviour of swarms of zombies, according to the most recent theories of their cognitive, sensorial and motion capabilities. In so doing, we also formulate recommendation on how the hero might survive while putting the minimum effort needed to succeed, thus helping keeping the sufficient amount of suspense in future research scripts.

AB In the recent times, most of the systems connected to Internet are getting infected with the malware and some of these systems are becoming zombies for the attacker. When user knowingly or unknowingly visits a malware website, his system gets infected. Attackers do this by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the web browser and acquire control over the underlying operating system. Once attacker compromises the users web browser, he can instruct the browser to visit the attackers website by using number of redirections. During the process, users web browser downloads the malware without the intervention of the user. Once the malware is downloaded, it would be placed in the file system and responds as per the instructions of the attacker. These types of attacks are known as Drive by Download attacks. Now-a-days, Drive by Download is the major channel for delivering the Malware. In this paper, Browser JS Guard an extension to the browser is presented for detecting and defending against Drive by Download attacks via HTML tags and JavaScript.

The long-forgotten revolutionary project launched by Auguste Comte in 1822 was hijacked and corrupted after his death, and now we confront a hybrid cyborg zombie, a dehumanized, automated adaptation to the post-structuralist situated knowledges of consumer sovereignty. #Comtebot: The positivist era is right now; the question is what kinds of politics it will have.

TI A Dynamic Microblog Network and Information Dissemination in "@" Mode
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Social media, especially the microblogs, emerge as a part of our daily life and become a key way to information spread. Thus, information dissemination in the microblog became a research hotspot. Based on some principles that are summarized from the microblog users' behaviors, this paper proposes a dynamic microblog network model. Through simulations this network has the features of periodicity of average degree, high clustering coefficient, high degree of modularity, and community. Besides, an information dissemination model through "@" in the microblog has been presented. With the microblog network model and the zombie- city model, this paper has modelled an artificial microblog and has simulated the information dissemination in the artificial microblog with different scenes. Therefore, some interesting findings have been presented. (1) Due to a better connectivity, information could spread widely in a random network; (2) information spreads more quickly in a stable microblog network; (3) the decay rate of the relationships will have an effect on information dissemination; that is, with a lower decay rate, information spreads more quickly and widely; (4) the higher active level of users in microblog could promote information spread widely and quickly; (5) the "@" mode of information dissemination makes a high modularity of the information diffusion network.

TI Functionalism AS A SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHY arguments
   about qualia can not be decisive
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB The aim of the article is to analyze anti-functionalist arguments in philosophy of mind and to show that there is a common intuition underlying both physicalist and anti-physicalist arguments. Both physicalists and anti-physicalists presuppose that two physical systems can be functionally identical, but different in respect to possessing consciousness. However, this intuition is precisely what functionalists contest. Therefore anti-functionalist arguments can only be successful if there would be given at least one scientifically plausible thought experiment showing what such system might possibly look like. The article is concluded with the analysis of Ned Block's famous thought experiment of a Chinese nation, which collectively governs a brainless body. This analysis is intended to show that this system will not be functionally identical to a human body and therefore it cannot be used as a decisive argument against functionalism.

TI Can the Conditional Analysis Strategy Help Physicalism?
SO JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
AB Braddon-Mitchell (2003), Hawthorne (2002), and Stalnaker (2002) provide a physicalistic argument that depends on the following two conditionals. If we experience dualistic pain, zombies are possible. On the other hand, if the actual world is physicalistic, zombies are impossible. Based on these conditionals, it is derived that zombies are conceivable but this does not entail their possibility. This line of argument for physicalism is referred to as the Conditional Analysis Strategy (CAS). I claim that the CAS does not help physicalists defuse the zombie argument. To show this, I first suggest that there are three possible interpretations of the strategy: the CAS explains the zombie intuition by virtue of the conceivability of zombies; the CAS conditionally disproves the entailment-link from conceivability to possibility; the CAS unconditionally denies the entailment-link I argue that none of the three understandings brings good news to physicalism.

TI The Shock of the Real: The Neoliberal Neurosis in the Life and Times of
   Jeffrey Sachs
SO ANTIPODE
AB This paper draws on Slavoj Ziek's critique of ideology in seeking to account for the persistence and transformability of the neoliberal project. Against understandings of neoliberalism as a utopian representation projected onto an external reality, I argue that neoliberal ideology operates as a social fantasy, which structures reality itself against the traumatic Real of Capital. The evolution of the neoliberal project should be understood, not as the meticulous manipulation of social reality, but as a series of increasingly desperate attempts to hold the very fabric of reality together. Reconceptualizing neoliberalization as a form of obsessional neurosis can help to explain the relentless persistence of zombie neoliberalism and its paradoxical trajectory towards increasingly intensive forms of social engineering. This argument is developed through a critical engagement with the work of the economist Jeffrey Sachs. From shock therapy to the Millennium Villages Project, Sachs's trajectory embodies the characteristics of the neoliberal neurosis. The paper aims to undermine the apparently monolithic power of neoliberalism, by challenging dominant critical representations of the neoliberal project in terms of a hyper-rational governmentality. It also aims to subvert the attempts by Jeffrey Sachs and other neoliberals to reposition themselves as opponents of the Washington Consensus, and as spokesmen of the Occupy movement. The chosen method of attack is more satirical than polemical. Neurotic neoliberals such as Sachs have successfully appropriated ethical objections to neoliberalism in the name of globalization with a human face. In the present conjuncture, an immanent critique that reveals the internal incoherence of neoliberal ideology, and the hapless floundering of its proponents, is perhaps more effective than a repetition of familiar forms of moral condemnation. An alternative subtitle for this paper might therefore be Towards a satirical materialism.

TI Zombies, the Uniformity of Nature, and Contingent Physicalism: A
   Sympathetic Response to Boran Bercic
SO PROLEGOMENA
AB Boran Bercic, in the second volume of his recent book Filozofija (2012), offers two responses to David Chalmers's conceivability or modal argument against physicalism. This latter argument aims at showing that zombies, our physical duplicates who lack consciousness, are metaphysically possible, given that they are conceivable. Bercic's first response is based on the principle of the uniformity of nature that states that causes of a certain type will always cause effects of the same type. His second response is based on the assumption that the basic statements of physicalism in philosophy of mind are or should be contingently true. I argue that if Bercic's first defence is aimed at the conceivability of zombies, it is unsatisfactory. Moreover, I argue that a quite similar argument, offered by John Perry in his book Knowledge, Possibility and Consciousness (2001), is afflicted by a similar problem. Nevertheless, under a more plausible interpretation, Bercic's argument might be taken to attack the metaphysical possibility of zombies. This version of the argument might be effective and has the merit to point out a so far overlooked link between the discussion of the Chalmers's conceivability arguments against physicalism and the modal strength of causal links and natural laws. Then, I argue that Bercic's second defence of physicalism, which cannot be combined consistently with his first one, in any case, should not be formulated in the terms of contingent physicalism.

TI The Origin of Cellular Life and Biosemiotics
SO BIOSEMIOTICS
AB Recent successes of systems biology clarified that biological functionality is multilevel. We point out that this fact makes it necessary to revise popular views about macromolecular functions and distinguish between local, physico-chemical and global, biological functions. Our analysis shows that physico-chemical functions are merely tools of biological functionality. This result sheds new light on the origin of cellular life, indicating that in evolutionary history, assignment of biological functions to cellular ingredients plays a crucial role. In this wider picture, even if aggregation of chance mutations of replicator molecules and spontaneously self-assembled proteins led to the formation of a system identical with a living cell in all physical respects but devoid of biological functions, it would remain an inanimate physical system, a pseudo-cell or a zombie-cell but not a viable cell. In the origin of life scenarios, a fundamental circularity arises, since if cells are the minimal units of life, it is apparent that assignments of cellular functions require the presence of cells and vice versa. Resolution of this dilemma requires distinguishing between physico-chemical and biological symbols as well as between physico-chemical and biological information. Our analysis of the concepts of symbol, rule and code suggests that they all rely implicitly on biological laws or principles. We show that the problem is how to establish physico-chemically arbitrary rules assigning biological functions without the presence of living organisms. We propose a solution to that problem with the help of a generalized action principle and biological harnessing of quantum uncertainties. By our proposal, biology is an autonomous science having its own fundamental principle. The biological principle ought not to be regarded as an emergent phenomenon. It can guide chemical evolution towards the biological one, progressively assigning greater complexity and functionality to macromolecules and systems of macromolecules at all levels of organization. This solution explains some perplexing facts and posits a new context for thinking about the problems of the origin of life and mind.

TI Negotiating Particularity in Neoliberalism Studies: Tracing Development
   Strategies Across Neoliberal Urban Governance Projects
SO ANTIPODE
AB A reading of critical perspectives on neoliberalism would suggest that it is dead but dominant, a revanchist zombie that appears paradoxically ubiquitous despite its inherent idiosyncrasy. We argue that neoliberalism's paradoxical death, dominance, and retrenchment can be interpreted by analyzing the dialectic of universalizing processes and particular forms within capitalism. Neoliberal projects draw political import from systemic, universalizing tendencies in capitalism, particularly those ideological processes by which contradictions and crises come to be discursively, institutionally, and politically conceptualized within the same paradigm from which they emerged. Building on well developed research frameworks in neoliberalism studies, we propose a set of analytical tools to interpret links between particular projects and homogenizing practices. We illustrate this with a case study of urban megaevents (eg Olympic Games or football World Cup), demonstrating how ideological commitments to event-based development strategies allow both the homogenizing imposition of entrepreneurial urban policy, and localized innovations in urban governance.

AB The local protest movement has raised a series of specific criminological issues (e.g. various forms of corruption, plunderage and violence) that one way or another relate to the question of control. Who or what controls the individual, capital, society and the state? Is the ethical and political ideal of individual and collective self-determination still able to inspire people, symbolized by the (ironic or cynical?) fatalism, feeling of helplessness, inner emptiness, jailhouse isolation, chronic fears, rumination of the media stupidity, crisis (spasmodic, but uncertain) management of everyday banality, and maybe even nasty impression that to the individual in these hopelessly ruined/perverted world remains only imbecilic/idiotic (hypocritical?) existence of the "zombie"? The answers to these questions should be sought from the perspective of maintaining social class power and the capitalist and labour struggles, thus this is the most appropriate theoretical basis for understanding and evaluating of the current criminal economy, which was formed as a counterrevolutionary reaction (of the "new liberalism") on the contradictions of "Keynesian project".

TI Circularity in the conditional analysis of phenomenal concepts
SO PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB The conditional analysis of phenomenal concepts purports to give physicalists a way of understanding phenomenal concepts that will allow them to (1) accept the zombie intuition, (2) accept that conceivability is generally a good guide to possibility, and yet (3) reject the conclusion that zombies are metaphysically possible. It does this by positing that whether phenomenal concepts refer to physical or nonphysical states depends on what the actual world is like. In this paper, I offer support for the Chalmers/Alter objection that the conditional analysis fails to accommodate the true zombie intuition, and develop a new and far more powerful argument against the conditional analysis. I argue that, as stated, the conditional analysis is radically incomplete. But when fully fleshed out, the analysis becomes viciously circular. The only way to avoid this circularity is to adopt a species of analytic functionalism, on which it's a priori that phenomenal concepts refer to the state (perhaps physical, perhaps nonphysical) that actually plays so-and-so functional role. While this rigidified analytic functionalism is coherent, it is highly unattractive, running contrary to both the intuitions that motivate functionalism and the intuitions that motivated the conditional analysis.

It is a repellent vision of posthumanity. Mindfulness is a therapeutic practice rooted in the meditative traditions of Buddhism.

Para-adaptation will serve as a springboard to problematize further the enthusiastic call for the expansion of adaptation studies by bringing in the emerging debate of post-celluloid adaptations the cultural practice of vernacular creativity. This attempt develops from a re-examination of the terms paracinema and paratextuality since amateur creativity has a direct dialectic relationship with practices that are relevant to these terms. In order to offer a more detailed debate on the ways amateur creativity can contribute to the expansion of adaptation studies I use amateur-made and industry-made renditions of the zombie mythology.

TI ZOMBIES, DRUGS, AND FLORIDA WEIRDNESS: "Imaginative power" and resonance
   in coverage of Miami's "Causeway Cannibal"
SO JOURNALISM STUDIES
AB On a steamy May 26, 2012 in Miami, Florida, police officers found Rudy Eugene viciously eating another man's face. Police shot Eugene at least four times, killing him, to stop the attack. Over the next month, the story of the Causeway Cannibal (a.k.a. the Miami Zombie) fueled debate about what spawned the attack. News explanations included synthetic drugs, cannibalism, Voodoo, and zombies. This textual analysis of immediate news explanations to the attack explores and speculates on why some explanations, such as mental illness, were ignored. By distinguishing between journalistic sensationalism and Ettema's journalistic imaginative power, this paper presents possible cultural reasons to explain why news media all but excluded mental illness as a dominant explanation for Eugene's actions.

TI NICE: Network Intrusion Detection and Countermeasure Selection in
   Virtual Network Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB Cloud security is one of most important issues that has attracted a lot of research and development effort in past few years. Particularly, attackers can explore vulnerabilities of a cloud system and compromise virtual machines to deploy further large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). DDoS attacks usually involve early stage actions such as multistep exploitation, low-frequency vulnerability scanning, and compromising identified vulnerable virtual machines as zombies, and finally DDoS attacks through the compromised zombies. Within the cloud system, especially the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds, the detection of zombie exploration attacks is extremely difficult. This is because cloud users may install vulnerable applications on their virtual machines. To prevent vulnerable virtual machines from being compromised in the cloud, we propose a multiphase distributed vulnerability detection, measurement, and countermeasure selection mechanism called NICE, which is built on attack graph-based analytical models and reconfigurable virtual network-based countermeasures. The proposed framework leverages OpenFlow network programming APIs to build a monitor and control plane over distributed programmable virtual switches to significantly improve attack detection and mitigate attack consequences. The system and security evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

TI How planners deal with uncomfortable knowledge: The dubious ethics of
   the American Planning Association
SO CITIES
AB With a point of departure in the concept "uncomfortable knowledge", this article presents a case study of how the American Planning Association (APA) deals with such knowledge. APA was found to actively suppress publicity of malpractice concerns and bad planning in order to sustain a boosterish image of planning. In the process, APA appeared to disregard and violate APA's own Code of Ethics. APA justified its actions with a need to protect APA members' interests, seen as preventing planning and planners from being presented in public in a bad light. The current article argues that it is in members' interest to have malpractice critiqued and reduced, and that this best happens by exposing malpractice, not by denying or diverting attention from it as APA did in this case. Professions, organizations, and societies that stifle critique tend to degenerate and become socially and politically irrelevant "zombie institutions". The article asks whether such degeneration has set in for APA and planning. Finally, it is concluded that more debate about APA's ethics and actions is needed for improving planning practice. Nine key questions are presented to constructively stimulate such debate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chalmers argues that ideal conceivability (conceivability on ideal rational reflection) entails possibility and on this basis assumes that zombies are possible and, therefore, that materialism is false. I argue that the paradigm cases of conceivability intuitions that Chalmers takes to be reliable guides to possibility are not only conceptually coherent, even on ideal rational reflection, but in addition have some rational explanation. The conceivability of zombies, however, has no rational explanation. So it is not ad hoc to deny that the conceivability of zombies entails possibility.

SO HITOTSUBASHI JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB Using the data from the Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry (FSSCI), we examine whether the decrease of corporate debt subsequent to the banking crisis in the late 1990s improved the efficiency of factor allocation at the microeconomic level. While the cross-sectoral movement of capital seems to have increased in the 2000s, negative profit is associated with the increase of corporate debt during the period of mild recovery in the mid-2000s. Thus even after the banking panic and the subsequent policy measures cleaned up major nonperforming loans, some nonnegligible number of "zombie firms" must have remained.

TI The Responsibilities of the Poor: Performing Neoliberal Citizenship
   within the Bureaucratic Field
SO SOCIAL SERVICE REVIEW
AB Social service providers are increasingly encouraged by their funders to help fashion the poor into neoliberal citizens, and this study investigates how this situation may affect the ways in which service users present themselves to service providers when seeking assistance. We suggest that our interview participants, drawn from vulnerable and marginalized populations of Winnipeg, Manitoba, are attuned to the characteristics of neoliberal citizenship that are increasingly valued among social service providers in Winnipeg. Indeed, just as neoliberal policies pressure social service agencies to embrace accountable, business-like, and individualizing models of service, so too are service users encouraged to adapt themselves to the demands of neoliberalism. In this context, our respondents represented themselves as active, prudent, autonomous, responsible, and entrepreneurial in an attempt to fashion an identity worthy of care within the contemporary bureaucratic field.

TI Parables for the paranoid: affect and the war gothic
SO CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL STUDIES
AB This paper discusses a series of horror war films set during the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq with the help of the concept of affect as outlined by Eve Sedgwick and Brian Massumi. The films studied in this paper combine the zombie genre with the military invasion story so that monstrous affect is always produced against what is referred to as a super-political landscape. In analysing these films, the paper abandons the a priori expectation that the use of affect will produce a set of sane (non-paranoid), fostering and liberating possibilities. The general argument of the paper is instead that these films simultaneously induce interpretative paranoia and present the spectator with the possibility that the foundation for this paranoia is inherently unstable. Thus, the paper ultimately explores the usefulness of affect on material that appears to lend itself to the traditional deconstructive endeavour and discerns points of commonality between deconstruction and affect studies.

TI Natural Concepts, Phenomenal Concepts, and the Conceivability Argument
SO ERKENNTNIS
AB The conceivability argument against materialism, originally raised by Saul Kripke and then reformulated, among others, by David Chalmers holds that we can conceive of the distinctness of a phenomenal state and its neural realiser, or, in Chalmers' variation of the argument, a zombie world. Here I argue that both phenomenal and natural kind terms are ambiguous between two senses, phenomenal and natural, and that the conceivability argument goes through only on one reading of a term. Thus, the antimaterialist has to provide some reasons independent of anti-materialism itself to favour that reading of a term that supports his or her argument. Given that there are no such independent reasons, I conclude that we should put more weight on empirical considerations than on a priori discussion in resolving the question concerning the identity between a phenomenal state and its neural realiser.

TI Redundancy of the Zombie Argument in The Conscious Mind
SO JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
AB This paper discusses the zombie argument and other anti-physicalist arguments presented by David Chalmers in his book, The Conscious Mind (1996). It is argued that both premises of the zombie argument - the conceivability of zombies and the conceivability-possibility thesis - cannot be made simultaneously plausible without additional argument in support of one of the premises. The best strategy for the proponent of the zombie argument is identified as limiting the conceivability-possibility thesis to an idealized notion of conceivability, and arguing separately for the conceivability of zombies in this idealized sense. Out of Chalmers' main arguments, the argument from epistemic asymmetry and the argument from absence of analysis are considered in this role. It is argued that, while either of the arguments would, if sound, be appropriate for the role, the first is subject to decisive counter-arguments. The second, on the other hand, is found not only suitable to support the zombie argument, but also more convincing in that its premises are less controversial. Since the argument from absence of analysis also establishes the falsity of physicalism directly by itself if sound, it can be seen to render the zombie argument redundant.

SO COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB In recent years, various computers have been compromised through several paths. In particular, the attack patterns and paths are becoming more various than in the past. Furthermore, systems damaged by hackers are used as zombie systems to attack other web servers or personal computers, so there is a high probability to spread secondary damage such as DDoS. Also, previously, hacking and malicious code were carried out for self-display or simple curiosity, but recently they are related to monetary extortion. In order to respond to incidents correctly, it is important to measure the damage to a system rapidly and determine the attack paths. This paper will discuss an on-site investigation methodology for incident response and also describe the limitations of this methodology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPORT
AB According to a view defended by Hubert Dreyfus and others, elite athletes are totally absorbed while they are performing, and they act non-deliberately without any representational or conceptual thinking. By using both conceptual clarification and phenomenological description the article criticizes this view and maintains that various forms of conscious thinking and acting plays an important role before, during and after competitive events. The article describes in phenomenological detail how elite athletes use consciousness in their actions in sport; as planning, attention, thinking, decision, and monitoring of performance. Elite athletes do not act as zombies. It is concluded that qualia and phenomenal consciousness are important phenomena in elite sport.

   BUFFALO, NY 2008-2010
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS
AB This article examines residential vacancy patterns in Buffalo, NY, using data from a unique data set. It includes variables from HUD Aggregate USPS Administrative Data on Address Vacancies, the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 20052009, housing choice voucher (HCV) records of local public housing agencies, and municipal in rem property records. Multiple regression is used to identify significant relationships between vacancy patterns, socioeconomic characteristics, and institutional factors. The findings from this analysis suggest that the percent of vacant residential properties increases in census tracts with elevated poverty rates, higher percentages of renters receiving rental assistance, and long-term vacancies. They also suggest that the percent of abandoned residential properties increases in census tracts with highly concentrated black populations, elevated poverty rates, long-term vacancies, and higher percentages of business addresses. We conclude that these relationships are unique to older core cities experiencing systemic population and job losses. These cities struggle with a distinct type of long-term vacant and abandoned structures, which we label zombie properties. They can be contrasted with vacant and abandoned properties in transitional or regenerating areas. We offer recommendations for further analysis of zombie properties in these urban settings.

TI Undead-Ends: Zombie Debt/Zombie Theory
SO POSTMODERN CULTURE
AB This essay examines the ways in which contemporary economic discourse uses the zombie metaphor. It situates these uses in relation to the current resurgence of zombies in popular fiction and film, and distinguishes zombies from vampires: while the former signifies global debt and stagnation, the latter connotes credit and consumer boom. It argues that the arc of desire and fear engendered by these figures of horror discloses a continuity in the affective trajectory of neo-liberalism as it supplants traditional philosophical distinctions between material and symbolic forms of debt. Rather than operating with a distinction between spiritual and financial modes of guilt/debt, an economic absorption of cultural values circumvents the need for subjective or symbolic inscriptions, and institutes the debt-relation directly and materially.

TI Fragmentation Considered Vulnerable
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEM SECURITY
AB We show that fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 traffic is vulnerable to effective interception and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by an off-path attacker. Specifically, we demonstrate a weak attacker intercepting more than 80% of the data between peers and causing over 94% loss rate.
   We show that our attacks are practical through experimental validation on popular industrial and open-source products, with realistic network setups that involve NAT or tunneling and include concurrent legitimate traffic as well as packet losses. The interception attack requires a zombie agent behind the same NAT or tunnel-gateway as the victim destination; the DoS attack only requires a puppet agent, that is, a sandboxed applet or script running in web-browser context.
   The complexity of our attacks depends on the predictability of the IP Identification (ID) field which is typically implemented as one or multiple counters, as allowed and recommended by the IP specifications. The attacks are much simpler and more efficient for implementations, such as Windows, which use one ID counter for all destinations. Therefore, much of our focus is on presenting effective attacks for implementations, such as Linux, which use per-destination ID counters.
   We present practical defenses for the attacks presented in this article, the defenses can be deployed on network firewalls without changes to hosts or operating system kernel.

TI Preserving quality of service for normal users against DDoS attacks by
   using Double Check Priority Queues
SO JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
AB Owing to the increasing threat of malwares and attacks, the defense mechanism design of various attacks becomes an important issue. Currently, there are various kinds of malwares, such as computer viruses, Trojanhorses, spywares, adwares, worms, and zombies, etc. Attacks are like zero-day attack, black-hole attack, Denial of Service attacks, man-in-the-middle attack and so on. The above attacks will be threats to the computer systems. This article focuses on the defense mechanism for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks use a lot of request packets or garbage packets to occupy network bandwidth and consume performance of the target host. If the attack target is a commercial website, DDoS attacks will cause transmission delay and more seriously they will deny web services. In this paper, we propose a Double Check Priority Queue structure that effectively mitigates the impact of DDoS attacks in order that normal users can still access services.

TI HE WAS LIKE A ZOMBIE: OFF-LABEL PRESCRIPTION OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS IN
   DEMENTIA
SO MEDICAL LAW REVIEW
AB This paper explores the legal position of the off-label prescription of antipsychotic medications to people with dementia who experience behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Dementia is a challenging illness, and BPSD can be very difficult for carers to manage, with evidence that this contributes to carer strain and can result in the early institutionalisation of people with dementia. As a result, the prescription of antipsychotic and other neuroleptic medications to treat BPSD has become commonplace, in spite of these drugs being untested and unlicensed for use to treat older people with dementia. In recent years, it has become apparent through clinical trials that antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and death in people with dementia. In addition, these types of medication also have other risk factors for people with dementia, including over-sedation and worsening of cognitive function. Drawing on recent questionnaire (n 185), focus group (n 15), and interview (n 11) data with carers of people with dementia, this paper explores the law relating to off-label prescription, and the applicability of medical negligence law to cases where adverse events follow the use of antipsychotic medication. It is argued that the practice of off-label prescribing requires regulatory intervention in order to protect vulnerable patients.

TI "The Unreturning Army that Was Youth": Social Reproduction and
   Apocalypse in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy
SO CONTEMPORARY WOMENS WRITING
AB This article considers Pat Barker's complex evocations of futurity and decay in the Regeneration trilogy. By attending to the trilogy's entangled temporalities and tactile imagery, I argue that Barker represents wartime England as haunted by a postwar incarnation of itself so unrecognizable that it is anticipated in apocalyptic terms. Through an extended analysis of the relationship between Billy Prior and Sarah Lumb, I posit that Barker connects the politics of remembrance to the politics of social reproduction. Her foregrounding of "cyborgian" (Brannigan) working-class femininities and zombie-esque masculinities-materialized, respectively, in landscapes of iron and mud-not only underscores the failures and limits of supposedly regenerative heterosexual intimacy in the context of war. It also displaces fecundity from the heterosexual couple onto the apocalyptic landscape itself, mapping the anticipation of a mutant and misshapen body politic onto England as a site of ruin, decay, and haunting. By reanimating the trench imagery of the soldier poets and extending it to the home front, Barker's trilogy participates in what Roger Simon calls "public time," in which testament is taken up as a "difficult inheritance" and reoriented toward a more just future.

AB Modal arguments like the Knowledge Argument, the Conceivability Argument and the Inverted Spectrum Argument could be used to argue for experiential primitivism; the view that experiential truths aren't entailed from nonexperiential truths. A way to resist these arguments is to follow Stoljar (Ignorance and imagination. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006) and plead ignorance of a type of experience-relevant nonexperiential truth. If we are ignorant of such a truth, we can't imagine or conceive of the various sorts of scenarios that are required to make these arguments sound. While I am sympathetic to this response, in this article I will argue that we have good reason to believe that this particular ignorance hypothesis is false.

TI Death and Taxes and Zombies
SO IOWA LAW REVIEW
AB The United States stands on the precipice of a financial disaster, and Congress has done nothing but bicker. Of course, I refer to the coming day when the undead walk the earth, feasting upon the living. A zombie apocalypse will create an urgent need for significant government revenues to protect the living, while at the same time rendering a large portion of the taxpaying public dead or undead. The government's failure to anticipate or plan for this eventuality could cripple its ability to respond effectively, putting us all at risk.
   This Essay fills a glaring gap in the academic literature by examining how the estate and income tax laws apply to the undead. It begins by examining the critical question of whether the undead should be considered dead for estate tax purposes; it then addresses income tax issues the undead are likely to raise. In addition to zombies, this Essay considers how estate and income tax laws should apply to vampires and ghosts. Given the difficulties identified herein of applying existing tax law to the undead, new legislation may be warranted. However, any new legislation is certain to raise its own set of problems. The point here is not to identify the appropriate approach. Rather, it is to goad Congress and the Internal Revenue Service into action before it is too late.

TI DEAD, UNDEAD, AND ZOMBIE ZONES IN PROTOSTELLAR DISKS AS A FUNCTION OF
   STELLAR MASS
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We investigate the viability of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in X-ray ionized viscous accretion disks around both solar-type stars and very low mass stars. In particular, we determine the disk regions where the MRI can be shut off either by Ohmic resistivity (the so-called dead and undead zones) or by ambipolar diffusion (a region we term the zombie zone). We consider two stellar masses: M-* = 0.7M(circle dot) and 0.1M(circle dot). In each case, we assume that: the disk surface density profile is that of a scaled Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, with M-disk/M-* = 0.01 as suggested by current data; disk ionization is driven primarily by stellar X-rays, complemented by cosmic rays and radionuclides; and the stellar X-ray luminosity scales with bolometric luminosity as L-X/L-* approximate to 10(-3.5), as observed. Ionization rates are calculated with the moccasin Monte Carlo X-ray transport code, and ionization balance determined using a simplified chemical network, including well-mixed 0.1 mu m grains at various levels of depletion. We find that (1) ambipolar diffusion is the primary factor controlling MRI activity in disks around both solar-type and very low mass classical T Tauri stars. Assuming that the MRI yields the maximum possible field strength at each radius, we further find that: (2) the MRI-active layer constitutes only similar to 5%-10% of the total disk mass; (3) the accretion rate (M.) varies radially in both magnitude and sign (inward or outward), implying time-variable accretion as well as the creation of disk gaps and overdensities, with consequences for planet formation and migration; (4) achieving the empirical accretion rates in solar-type and very low mass stars requires a depletion of well-mixed small grains (via grain growth and/or settling) by a factor of 10-1000 relative to the standard dust-to-gas mass ratio of 10(-2); and (5) the current non-detection of polarized emission from field-aligned grains in the outer disk regions is consistent with active MRI at those radii.

AB Microblog is one of the most efficient and effective ways to spread information. This paper studies the information diffusion in Sina microblog and proposes a novel measurement of the activation probabilities based on Independent Cascade Model. The activation probabilities measure considers tweets, relationships, and users, so it is called TRU (Tweets, Relationships, and Users) measurement. We randomly select more than 3 million tweets to analyze and find that multimedia plays a very important role in information diffusion. The relationships contain not only the similarity of interests, but also behavioral momentum between two users. The users mainly consider a user's influence in the microblog network and we apply a PageRank-like algorithm to measure it. The TRU measurement has dynamic and heterogeneous nature. It is evaluated in a network with millions of users collected from Sina microblog. And the zombie fans whose followers or tweets are less than five have been cleared away. In the experiment, we do not take the parameters in the formula of activation probabilities for granted, but try different values time after time using different tweets to find out the best values. The result shows that TRU measurement can describe the actual information diffusion in microblog very well.

AB The potential use of games for serious purposes is huge because a large and growing population is already engaged with playing entertainment games. However, only a tiny fraction of the overall playing time is devoted to games that are designed for learning or health impact. The challenge is to develop such games that have broad enough impact that transfers to a variety of tasks. Working memory is of central importance for acquiring knowledge and involved in a variety of complex cognitive tasks and thus the use of working memory training games can lead to a wide range of significant impacts in peoples' life. The aim of this paper is to shed light on game design decisions that are founded on cognitive and neuropsychological theories, focusing especially on working memory training. We scrutinize the development of working memory game titled Brains vs Zombies that is designed to have transferrable impact on brain health and promote physical health in some level. The results of two small-scale pilot studies in which the implementation of Brains vs Zombies tablet game were studied are reported. The paper focus especially on user interface solutions of the game comparing button and motion based solutions. The results indicated that the opinions about the user interface solutions varied, but children appreciated the motion based user interface more than older university students. Furthermore, the findings showed that meaningful game elements can be added to usually monotone brain training programs to engage users.

AB Social networks such as Facebook, Orkut and so on, are repositories of information that are viewed as users' opinions. However, data mining across multiple social websites can reveal valuable factual information for both monitoring and reconstructing events. Crowdsourcing can be used on these sites to monitor 'flash mob' group behaviors, loosely or formally planned activities, such as 'zombie walks'. In certain contexts, these walks are 'marketed' to social site users in order to promote charitable or social engagements; in others, analysis suggests that participation is a form of political engagement. We use multi-platform information extraction to build an atlas of geographic and demographic events, which leads us to compelling, yet imperfect, understanding of why events are successful and regionally relevant factors that encourage people to pick up behaviors or participate in movements. More generally, this case study confirms that `big-data'-led analysis of this kind is reasonably straightforward and rewarding, as well as providing a useful basis for Bayesian reasoning: the use of available evidence to evaluate propositions about this type of events.

Drawing on qualitative methods, in particular autophenomenography, this research maps out a 'Zombies, Run'! running aesthetic where body, environment, and technologies are interweaved and absorbed into the creation of local essences relating to this particular way of running. Considerations on body rhythm, practiced and novice runners, and a deepened awareness of running locations are described and analysed as key features of experiencing movement with this running app in hand. "Feeling the way" towards the nuances of embodied movement contributes to an increased awareness of the range and complexity of sensuous details at work when moving with this modern mobile gaming app. But also, other significant situations are explored including the embrace of this modern Indie exer-game by women, and the situatedness of core game mechanics in code, audio/narrative, environment, and moving bodies. Running from zombies is a playful movement practice, albeit a disorienting one, in which ones running experience in the world sits with the pleasures of running, body knowledge, environmental engagement, and speed play.

AB An increasing number of security incidents on industrial control systems drew a lot of concerns lately. Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired.
   In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.

AB Recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of online social media. Weibo, a famous "Chinese Twitter", has attracted over half billion users in less than four years. Among them are zombie users or bogus users, who are seemingly active common users but actually marionettes manipulated by intelligent software for economic interests. To probe such users thus becomes critically important for a healthy Weibo, but the existing studies along this line are still in initial stage due to the serious lack of labeled zombies and the limited attributes for user profiling. In light of this, in this paper, we figure out a commercial way for training set labeling, and propose a two-stage cascading model called ProZombie for zombie user recognition. ProZombie decomposes the training/predicting process into fast and refined phases in cascade, which greatly improves the modeling efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover, 35 attributes including 16 newly proposed ones are employed for a panoramic description of Weibo users. Experiments on real-world labeled Weibo users demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProZombie. More interestingly, two case studies based on ProZombie successfully unveil the zombies hidden around common users, and their impact to information propagation on Weibo. To our best knowledge, this study is among the first to quantify these interesting observations on Weibo.

In the last third of twentieth century the myth underwent a profound transformation, which nevertheless represented a continuation of its previous unconscious meaning. The analysis of the new archetypal elements that it included, closely related to a nuclear aspect of the spirit of twentieth century art, enables us to develop an interpretive approach to a mythical framework and its underlying psychological process currently running through the collective psyche: respectively, the initiation death and the solvent and disintegrative dynamic of the soul. It will be based in the analytical psychology theoretical framework and we will use the historical-comparative method.

AB To research rumor diffusion in social friend network, based on interests, a dynamic friend network is proposed, which has the characteristics of clustering and community, and a diffusion model is also proposed. With this friend network and rumor diffusion model, based on the zombie-city model, some simulation experiments to analyze the characteristics of rumor diffusion in social friend networks have been conducted. The results show some interesting observations: (1) positive information may evolve to become a rumor through the diffusion process that people may modify the information by word of mouth; (2) with the same average degree, a random social network has a smaller clustering coefficient and is more beneficial for rumor diffusion than the dynamic friend network; (3) a rumor is spread more widely in a social network with a smaller global clustering coefficient than in a social network with a larger global clustering coefficient; and (4) a network with a smaller clustering coefficient has a larger efficiency.

Make a plan, and be prepared!" (CDC Website, April 26th, 2013).

TI Exploring a Quantum-Hebbian Approach Towards Learning and Cognition
SO NEUROQUANTOLOGY
AB Cognition, in all its diverse forms, can be attributed to the formation of specialized neural circuits in the brain. While in response to conscious experiences, arising due to sensory stimulation, neural assemblies are formed, conscious experience is itself an outcome of sustained synchronous firing of a neural assembly. This leads to a paradoxical situation or Neural Development Paradox - what comes first: the conscious experience or the neural assembly? To have zero-lag synchronous activity amongst neurons of an assembly, which is needed for binding individual responses into a conscious percept, we need a very rapid source of communication between them. Axonal conduction delays amounting to several tens of milliseconds cannot account for the zero-lag synchrony across spatially separated brain areas, which is required for STDP Hebbian learning to hardwire a neural assembly. Hence, an alternate means of instantaneous communication needs to be explored. According to the Penrose-Hameroff Quantum Approach towards consciousness, the microtubule cytoskeleton acts as a quantum computer whose collapsed states are conscious experiences manifesting in the form of an activated neural assembly. Neurons, whose microtubules are entangled, get connected by means of gap junctions, behaving like one giant neuron, firing in synchrony, seemingly breaking the Neural Development Paradox. By mental force of directed attention, Quantum Zeno Effect can be instigated, as suggested by Von Neumann-Stapp, causing the activated state of the brain to stabilize till Hebbian learning strengthens the synaptic connections, giving way to a quantum explanation for the formation of neural assemblies, both intra-modality as well as inter-modality. In this paper we report our efforts towards building a simulation-mathematical model of Quantum-Hebbian Learning that attempts to interface classical Hebbian learning with quantum theoretic mechanisms of conscious experience to develop neural assemblies. Under the influence of the modulatory mental force of directed attention, the model is also able to address high level issues like mind wandering, zombie modes, volition etc. The model is an attempt to study the benefits of introducing the concept of duality in the formation of neural assemblies and understand how consciousness and attention influence the development of the brain.

AB Although Wayne Wu correctly identifies a flaw in the way in which my 2009 article frames the debate about 'zombie action', he fails in his attempts to strengthen the case for thinking that our actions are under less conscious control than we usually imagine. His argument, like the arguments that my earlier paper addressed, can be blocked by allowing that an embodied demonstrative concept can contribute contents to a visual experience.

TI Research on an Infectious Disease Transmission by Flocking Birds
SO SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
AB The swarm intelligence is becoming a hot topic. The flocking of birds is a natural phenomenon, which is formed and organized without central or external controls for some benefits (e. g., reduction of energy consummation). However, the flocking also has some negative effects on the human, as the infectious disease H7N9 will easily be transmited from the denser flocking birds to the human. Zombie-city model has been proposed to help analyzing and modeling the flocking birds and the artificial society. This paper focuses on the H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and from the flocking birds to the human. And some interesting results have been shown: (1) only some simple rules could result in an emergence such as the flocking; (2) the minimum distance between birds could affect H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and even affect the virus transmissions from the flocking birds to the human.

AB Putting the user in charge of their online identity is a necessary precondition for privacy on the web. This requires the ability to manage identifying information that remote parties store in data repositories on the user's device. We performed a crawl of thousands of popular websites with the intention of assessing the prevalence of various problematic patterns of client-side data storage. The focus of this paper is on techniques that make use of the browser cache, especially when they impede active identity management by the user. From these results, we derive a novel privacy-enhancing policy for client-side data storage - self-destructing identifiers - improving the current defacto standard. This policy has already seen some adoption in practice in the form of a Firefox add-on that we developed as a proof of concept.

AB ADSL routers are an integral part of today's home and small office networks. Typically, these devices are provided by a user's ISP and are, usually, managed by people who do not have any special technical knowledge. Often poorly configured and vulnerable, such devices are an easy target for network-based attacks, allowing cyber-criminals to quickly and easily gain control over a network. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the security of ADSL routers and identifY the potential of attacks, which attempt to compromise the vulnerabilities of their web interface. More specifically, we present common vulnerabilities and attacks that occur in websites on the Internet, and project them on the special characteristics of the web management interface of ADSL routers. To put this analysis into a practical context, we investigate the security of a popular ADSL router provided by a Greek iSP. in this security assessment, we have discovered two O-day vulnerabilities in the web management interface of the tested router. In particular, we discovered an operating system (OS) command injection and stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. A malicious may exploit these vulnerabilities to perform several large-scale attacks. Specifically, he/she can perform DNS hijacking attack and redirect the users to fake web sites for phishing; mount a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using the compromised routers as zombie machines; or even spread a malware. Finally, we discuss some well-known security practices that should be followed from developers and users to enhance the security of ADSL routers.

Here, we'll look deeply into the symbolic genealogy that comes before and it's inserted in zombie conception in Seabrook's The magic island (first text where zombie appears as living dead) through a comparative analysis with the somnambulist in literature and filmography of "the dark side of animal magnetism and hypnosis" and its connection with the automaton.

   volatility in Japan
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES
AB De Veirman, Emmanuel, and Levin, Andrew T. When did firms become more different? Time-varying firm-specific volatility in Japan
   We document how firm-specific volatility in sales, earnings and employment growth evolved year by year in Japan. Our volatility measure also indicates the evolution of firm turnover. We find that patterns in firm-specific volatility have changed when macroeconomic circumstances have. Firm turnover declined during the economic stagnation of 1991-1997. The deep downturn of fiscal years 1998-2002 coincided with a substantial increase in turnover in market, profit and employment shares. Firm volatility tended to decline during the recovery after 2002. We assess whether the rise in firm turnover and deep downturn in 1998-2002 indicate that after a period of stagnation, weak firms were finally allowed to shrink or fail. Our evidence suggests that the widening in the firm growth distribution at that time did not reflect weak firms shrinking relative to healthy firms, indicating that the two recessions in 1998-2002 were not "cleansing".

TI Feeling robots and human zombies: Mind perception and the uncanny valley
SO COGNITION
AB The uncanny valley-the unnerving nature of humanlike robots-is an intriguing idea, but both its existence and its underlying cause are debated. We propose that humanlike robots are not only unnerving, but are so because their appearance prompts attributions of mind. In particular, we suggest that machines become unnerving when people ascribe to them experience (the capacity to feel and sense), rather than agency (the capacity to act and do). Experiment 1 examined whether a machine's humanlike appearance prompts both ascriptions of experience and feelings of unease. Experiment 2 tested whether a machine capable of experience remains unnerving, even without a humanlike appearance. Experiment 3 investigated whether the perceived lack of experience can also help explain the creepiness of unfeeling humans and philosophical zombies. These experiments demonstrate that feelings of uncanniness are tied to perceptions of experience, and also suggest that experience-but not agency-is seen as fundamental to humans, and fundamentally lacking in machines.

TI Zombie Media: Circuit Bending Media Archaeology into an Art Method
SO LEONARDO
AB This text is an investigation into media culture, temporalities of media objects and planned obsolescence in the midst of ecological crisis and electronic waste. The authors approach the topic under the umbrella of media archaeology and aim to extend this historiographically oriented field of media theory into a methodology for contemporary artistic practice. Hence, media archaeology becomes not only a method for excavation of repressed and forgotten media discourses, but extends itself into an artistic method close to Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culture, circuit bending, hardware hacking and other hacktivist exercises that are closely related to the political economy of information technology. The concept of dead media is discussed as "zombie media"-dead media revitalized, brought back to use, reworked.

TI Exemplarization: a solution to the problem of consciousness?
SO PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB In recent publications, Keith Lehrer developed the intriguing idea of a special mental process-exemplarization-and applied it in a sophisticated manner to different phenomena such as intentionality, representation of the self, the knowledge of ineffable content (of art works) and the problem of phenomenal consciousness. In this paper I am primarily concerned with the latter issue. The target of this paper is to analyze whether exemplarization, besides explaining epistemic phenomena such as immediate and ineffable knowledge of experiences, can also solve the ontological problem of consciousness. In particular, Lehrer suggests that if we consider exemplarization, zombies cannot provide an argument for anti-physicalism. I argue that exemplarization offers neither a physicalist explanation of the conceivability of zombies nor an elucidating physicalist account of their impossibility. Therefore, exemplarization cannot offer a physicalist solution to the "hard problem" of consciousness.

TI Physical-Effect Epiphenomenalism and Common Underlying Causes
SO DIALOGUE-CANADIAN PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW
AB Qualia epiphenomenalism is the view that qualitative properties of events, such as the raw feel of tastes or painfulness, lack causal efficacy. One common objection to qualia epiphenomenalism is the epistemic argument, which states that this loss of causal efficacy undermines our capacity to know about these epiphenomenal qualitative properties (Sterjnberg, 1999; Watkins, 1989). A number of rejoinders have been offered up to insulate qualia epiphenomenalism from the epistemic argument. In this paper I consider and ultimately reject two such replies, namely, the common underlying cause reply and the appeal to physical-effect epiphenomenalism.

TI THE JESTER, THE ZOMBIE AND THE SIMPLETON : THREE REPRESENTATIVES OF
   POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MADNESS ON TODAY'S STAGES
SO ETUDES LITTERAIRES
AB This article focuses on three politically and socially mad characters who have prevailed in a body of European writings over the last 15 years, and who have been sketching a theater of madness for our times. In the process, this article presents a socio-critical approach to the comedic elements of contemporary theater. The three characters at issue are the "jester", the "zombie" and the "simpleton", each shining a light on a different set of challenges in today's Western societies. The jester, more particularly the Ubuesque one, represents the chasm between power and the indignity of those wielding it, echoing European worries about the fragility of democracy. As the walking dead who gave his insubstantial, fake and subjective life to the lure of consumer goods, the zombie evokes consumerism. Lastly, the simpleton's improbable ingenuousness and his inherent inability to adapt to his surroundings restrict to a minimum his interaction with figures of power, thereby making him the only "madman" in contemporary theater to have retained an ability to express a life force.

TI Adaptive pattern mining model for early detection of botnet-propagation
   scale
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Botnets are a disastrous threat because they execute malicious activities such as distributed denial-of-service, spam email, malware downloads (such as eggdownloads), and spying by exploiting zombie PCs under their control. Botnets infect PCs on a huge scale by initially scanning the service ports of vulnerable applications for the purpose of propagation, which is leveraged as the size of the botnet increases. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to detect botnet-propagation activities early and to determine the expectedsize of the attack. To address this issue, this paper proposes to recreate botnets' port-scanning patterns using a simple text classifier that represents these patterns as a kind of matrix. The patterns obtained are then used to train a hidden Markov model and to perform early detection using the trained model. Early detection is achievable by catching the onset of suspicious propagation immediately, and a size estimate is obtained by monitoring fluctuations in botnet size. With this approach, early-detection rates increased to more than 30.6% on average, with a low false negative rate (less than 6%) and an F-measure greater than 96%. This significant improvement in performance will contribute to preventing botnet propagation in its earliest stages. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO LITERATURE AND THEOLOGY
AB Though the question 'how is a zombie like a saint?' may seem little more than a tantalising premise, a bit of whimsical scholarship that dabbles in unlikely syllogisms, the central interest of this parallel lies not in direct comparison of these disparate living-dead so much as investigation of a strange commonality of metaphors that they share. Though both the zombie and the saint defy the border between life and death, this article describes the way that each operates in a dialectical capacity concerning metaphors of colonisation and contamination. The zombie is simultaneously a figure for the slave (as we can trace its origins to Haiti) and slave rebellion: its morbid immortality connotes rebellion, and defiance. The zombie is at once a feeble corpse and yet, it nonetheless wields a subversive power. The martyred saints investigated here, St Denis and St Edmund the King, are each, simultaneously, stand-ins for the subjugated and the sovereign, the sick as well as the cured. These metaphoric categories overlap, informing and shaping each other. In the tales of the Christian martyrs, this works to represent conversion as capable of spreading like disease, of faith as a spiritual colonisation.

TI Haitian Vodou and Voodoo: Imagined Religion and Popular Culture
SO STUDIES IN RELIGION-SCIENCES RELIGIEUSES
AB Vodou is frequently invoked as a cause of Haiti's continued impoverishment. While scholarly arguments have been advanced for why this is untrue, Vodou is persistently plagued by a poor reputation. This is buttressed, in part, by the frequent appearance in popular culture of the imagined religion of "voodoo." Vodou and voodoo have entwined destinies, and Vodou will continue to suffer from ill repute as long as voodoo remains an outlet for the expression of racist anxieties. The enduring appeal of voodoo is analyzed through its uses in touristic culture, film, television, and literature. Particular attention is given to the genre of horror movies, in which voodoo's connections with violence against whites and hypersexuality are exploited to produce both terror and arousal.

TI Quining diet qualia
SO CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
AB This paper asks whether we can identify a neutral explanandum for theories of phenomenal consciousness, acceptable to all sides. The 'classic' conception of qualia, on which qualia are intrinsic, ineffable, and subjective, will not serve this purpose, but it is widely assumed that a watered-down 'diet' conception will. I argue that this is wrong and that the diet notion of qualia has no distinctive content. There is no phenomenal residue left when qualia are stripped of their intrinsicality, ineffability, and subjectivity. Thus, if we reject classic qualia realism, we should accept that all that needs explaining are 'zero' qualia - our dispositions to judge that our experiences have classic qualia. Diet qualia should, in Dennett's phrase, be quined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A priori physicalism, lonely ghosts and cartesian doubt
SO CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
AB A zombie is a physical duplicates of a human being which lacks consciousness. A ghost is a phenomenal duplicate of a human being whose nature is exhausted by consciousness. Discussion of zombie arguments, that is anti-physicalist arguments which appeal to the conceivability of zombies, is familiar in the philosophy of mind literature, whilst ghostly arguments, that is, anti-physicalist arguments which appeal to the conceivability of ghosts, are somewhat neglected. In this paper I argue that ghostly arguments have a number of dialectical advantages over zombie arguments. I go onto explain how the conceivability of ghosts is inconsistent with two kinds of a priori physicalism: analytic functionalism and the Australian physicalism of Armstrong and Lewis.

TI The nurses' role in the prevention of Solanum infection: dealing with a
   zombie epidemic
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB Aims. To outline the background and nursing interventions for Solanum infection in the event of a zombie epidemic. Background. Literature and feature film evidence supports the theoretical probability for an outbreak of a Solanum infection which could result in a zombie epidemic. This paper discusses the causative agent, history of zombiism, signs and symptoms, diagnosis and nursing interventions. Design. Review. Methods. Academic and general literature and web sites were searched up to February 2011 for the key words, zombie, zombie nurses, zombie epidemic and zombie nursing interventions. Limited academic literature was sourced pointing to a serious knowledge deficit in this area. Results. If nurses are to respond successfully to a potential Solanum epidemic they need to be prepared and able to recognise Solanum infection, prevent its spread and care appropriately for sufferers and victims of a zombie attack. Advice is offered on prevention, initial nursing management and secondary nursing interventions including dealing with reanimation, palliative care and psychological support. Conclusion. History offers numerous examples of the sudden appearance of a serious disease that has impacted on man kinds survival. While difficult to conceive, a zombie epidemic is theoretically possible and nurses have a responsibility to be as prepared as possible to support and care for victims. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses are likely to be the front line staff faced with initiating most primary and secondary care interventions, including isolation and infection control, wound care, pain relief, documentation observations, support for activities of daily living, nutrition and fluid support, medication administration and other interventions.

TI Detection of Zombie PCs Based on Email Spam Analysis
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB While botnets are used for various malicious activities, it is well known that they are widely used for email spam. Though the spam filtering systems currently in use block IPs that send email spam, simply blocking the IPs of zombie PCs participating in a botnet is not enough to prevent the spamming activities of the botnet because these IPs can easily be changed or manipulated. This IP blocking is also insufficient to prevent crimes other than spamming, as the botnet can be simultaneously used for multiple purposes. For this reason, we propose a system that detects botnets and zombie PCs based on email spam analysis. This study introduces the concept of "group pollution level" - the degree to which a certain spam group is suspected of being a botnet - and "IP pollution level" - the degree to which a certain IP in the spam group is suspected of being a zombie PC. Such concepts are applied in our system that detects botnets and zombie PCs by grouping spam mails based on the URL links or attachments contained, and by assessing the pollution level of each group and each IP address. For empirical testing, we used email spam data collected in an "email spam trap system" Korea's national spam collection system. Our proposed system detected 203 botnets and 18,283 zombie PCs in a day and these zombie PCs sent about 70% of all the spam messages in our analysis. This shows the effectiveness of detecting zombie PCs by email spam analysis, and the possibility of a dramatic reduction in email spam by taking countermeasure against these botnets and zombie PCs.

TI Pattern Programmable Kernel Filter for Bot Detection
SO DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Bots earn their unique name as they perform a wide variety of automated task. These tasks include stealing sensitive user information. Detection of bots using solutions such as behavioral correlation of flow records, group activity in DNS traffic, observing the periodic repeatability in communication, etc., lead to monitoring the network traffic and then classifying them as Bot or normal traffic. Other solutions for Bot detection include kernel level key stroke verification, system call initialization, IP black listing, etc. In the first two solutions there is no assurance that the packet carrying user information is prevented from being sent to the attacker and the latter suffers from the problem of IP spoofing. This motivated us to think of a solution that would filter out the malicious packets before being put onto the network. To come out with such a solution, a real time bot attack was generated with Spy Eye Exploit kit and traffic characteristics were analyzed. The analysis revealed the existence of a unique repeated communication between the Zombie machine and the botmaster. This motivated us to propose, a Pattern Programmable Kernel Filter (PPKF) for filtering out the malicious packets generated by bots. PPKF was developed using the windows filtering platform (WFP) filter engine. PPKF was programmed to filter out the packets with unique pattern which were observed from the bot attack experiments. Further PPKF was found to completely suppress the flow of packets having the programmed uniqueness in them thus preventing the functioning of bots in terms of user information being sent to the Botmaster.

TI Slaves, Cannibals, and Infected Hyper-Whites: The Race and Religion of
   Zombies
SO ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
AB The first decade of the new millennium saw renewed interest in popular culture featuring zombies. This essay shows that a comparative analysis of nightmares can be a productive method for analyzing salient themes in the imaginative products and practices of cultures in close contact. It is argued that zombies, as the first modern monster, are embedded in a set of deeply symbolic structures that are a matter of religious thought. The author draws from her ethnographic work in Haiti to argue that the zonbi is at once part of the mystical arts that developed there since the colonial period, and comprises a form of mythmaking that represents, responds to, and mystifies the fear of slavery, collusion with it, and rebellion against it. In turn, some elements of the Haitian zonbi figure can be found in patterns that haunt recent American zombie films. Zombies in these films are read as figures in a parable about whiteness and death-dealing consumption. This essay suggests that the messianic mood surrounding the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama was consistent with a pattern in zombie films since the 1960s where many zombie-killing heroes are figured as black American males. Zombies are used in both ethnographic and film contexts to think through the conditions of embodiment, the boundaries between life and death, repression and freedom, and the racialized ways in which humans consume other humans.

AB The paper describes a challenging clinical encounter with an adolescent undergoing treatment for cancer. Undeniably, oncologists have a very challenging job. It requires more than simply diagnosing and treating cancer by giving chemotherapy and checking blood counts. The challenges they face are increased when caring for a teenager with cancer. Providing opportunities for these young patients to be involved in their own treatment and motivating them in tough times are crucial. Communication is the foremost way to keep all doors open in this unique physician-patient relationship. One such approach is "movie therapy" using characters and actions as metaphors for describing cancer and cancer treatment.

TI Phenomenal Realist Physicalism Implies Coherency of Epiphenomenalist

AB Recent criticisms of epiphenomenalism include a meaning objection. This is a self-stultification objection according to which epiphenomenalism is incoherent, because phenomenal terms could not mean what epiphenomenalists say they mean if epiphenomenalism were true. This paper seeks to remove the sting of this objection by showing that one can construct a coherent epiphenomenalist theory of meaning from any coherent account that may be offered by a phenomenal realist physicalist. This argument bears adversely on an important argument offered by Balog (1999), and some arguments given in support of her view can be re-targeted as arguments against my conclusion. These arguments are reviewed and answered.

TI Detecting Spam Zombies by Monitoring Outgoing Messages
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB Compromised machines are one of the key security threats on the Internet; they are often used to launch various security attacks such as spamming and spreading malware, DDoS, and identity theft. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the detection of the compromised machines in a network that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the developed SPOT system using a two-month e-mail trace collected in a large US campus network. Our evaluation studies show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the e-mail trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only seven internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT. In addition, we also compare the performance of SPOT with two other spam zombie detection algorithms based on the number and percentage of spam messages originated or forwarded by internal machines, respectively, and show that SPOT outperforms these two detection algorithms.

AB Panoramas, as a medium, have traditionally provided viewers with an encompassing experience of distant locations. In recent years, this experience has been augmented by combining handheld orientation sensors with digital panoramas to create mixed reality experiences that transform mobile devices into windows to the remote. Less explored, have been the mixed reality opportunities afforded through the viewing of mobile panoramas non-remotely, at or near their real world epicenters. This paper presents two handheld AR web applications, running on publicly available hardware and software, that utilize panoramas to facilitate both remote and on-location AR experiences. It explores how the experience and the utility of a panorama differ depending on the location in which it is viewed.

AB In application-layer distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, zombie machines attack the victim server through legitimate packets such that packets have legitimate format and are sent through normal TCP connections. Consequently, neither intrusion detection systems (IDS) nor victim server can detects malicious packets. This paper proposes a novel scheme which is called ConnectionScore to resist against such DDoS attacks. During the attack time, any connection is scored based on history and statistical analysis which has been done during the normal condition. The bottleneck resources are retaken from those connections which take lower scores. Our analysis shows that connections established by the adversary give low scores. In fact, ConnectionScore technique can estimate legitimacy of connections with high probability. To evaluate performance of the scheme, we perform experiments on Emulab environment using real traceroute data of ClarkNet WWW server. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to emergence of wireless networks and immense use of hand held devices, wireless networks encounter a great threat of denial of service attack. Traditionally IP-Based Filtering has been used to combat these attacks, however studies shows that thousands of distributed zombies work in cooperation generate huge network traffic that result in distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks and illegitimate access to resources and services. In this paper, first we studied attacks and mitigation scenarios to analyze network wide DDoS security anomalies. This will help us to drive supplementary active measurements to characterize the strength and characteristic of attacks to improve correlation of our log data and with other publicly available network traffic analysis data. Secondly, we presented a monitoring scheme to simulate a variety of attacks on different mobile operating system. This will identify the potential threat of different DDoS attacks for such platform and traffic scanning activity to avoid detection of attacks such as Ping to Death DDoS attack. Third, we followed proceedings of an enduring basis to extort trends in the attack frequency, make-up, and production of extensive DDoS attacks. This longitudinal analysis was necessary for understanding the progression of the threats and vulnerabilities. In conclusion, while analyzing our early results concerning large-scale DDoS attack. We used a hybrid approach to diminish and prevent the attack. Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) is used to imitate the real environment and to create attack traffic with different attack strength. The simulation results are encouraging as we were able to establish, and approximate strength of DDoS attack efficiently (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Engaging an array of theoretical traditions including feminist writing on bodies, anthropological perspectives on possession trances, and the masterful psychoanalytic concepts of Freud and Lacan this article links reflections on dissociative "pathology" with the everyday realities of life under corporate capitalism, especially as they play out in the service industry. It examines serving as walking death. First the context in which we find the animated corpse is elaborated; then the conditions of its production and its practical and theoretical significance are 'explored. I argue that serving customers at a corporate chain effects death in life in one of two ways: the death of oneself absent in an entranced automatism a self identified with a corporate agenda, often lost as the body rises to the surface or the hyper-happy death of one's honest connection with a body whose cues are ignored and senses converted as it is transcended by a mind defined by the corporation as right.

TI THE CONTROVERSY ON PSYCHOPHYSICAL REDUCION AND ITS METHODOLOGICAL
   IMPLICATIONS
SO PROBLEMOS
AB The object of this paper is the controversy about the materialist accounts of sensory qualia in analytic philosophy of recent decades. The first section deals with the identity thesis and reductionist strategy connected to it that has established and shaped the development of materialist problematics as central to philosphy of mind. The second section discusses two most influential antireductionist arguments - the knowledge argument and the argument from the conceivability of zombies. The the paper focuses on the epistemological and semantic aspects of the controversy that can be translated into the different interpretations of two-dimensional modal matrix, which allows to specify the disagreement between reductionism and antireductionism. Finally the conclusion arrived at in the last section is that the premises of antireductionist arguments are not compatible with the stable connection between mental and physiological domains, and thus contemporary philosophy of mind brings out the dilemma: either we hypostatize the introspectively available qualitative content on the basis of epistemic asymmetry of the mental and physical concepts, thereby deriving a dualist ontology, and embrace all the sceptical consequences, or we prefer the extensional explanation of concepts, without internalist ambitions, conceivability of zombies, and antireductionist conclusions.

AB Social computational systems emerge in the wild on popular social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, but there remains confusion about the relationship between social interactions and the technical traces of interaction left behind through use. Twitter interactions and social experience are particularly challenging to make sense of because of the wide range of tools used to access Twitter (text message, website, iPhone, TweetDeck and others), and the emergent set of practices for annotating message context (hashtags, reply to's and direct messaging). Further, Twitter is used as a back channel of communication in a wide range of contexts, ranging from disaster relief to watching television. Our study examines Twitter as a transport protocol that is used differently in different sociotechnical contexts, and presents an analysis of how researchers might begin to approach studies of Twitter interactions with a more reflexive stance toward the application programming interfaces (APIs) Twitter provides. We conduct a careful review of existing literature examining socio-technical phenomena on Twitter, revealing a collective inconsistency in the description of data gathering and analysis methods. In this paper, we present a candidate architecture and methodological approach for examining specific parts of the Twittersphere. Our contribution begins a discussion among social media researchers on the topic of how to systematically and consistently make sense of the social phenomena that emerge through Twitter. This work supports the comparative analysis of Twitter studies and the development of social media theories.

AB Botnets are growing in size, number and impact. It continues to be one of the top three web threats that mankind has ever known. The botnets are the souped-up cyber engines driving nearly all criminal commerce on the Internet and are seen as relaying millions of pieces of junk e-mail, or spam. Thus, the need of the hour is the early detection and identification of the heart of network packet flooding or the C&C centre. Most of the botmasters perform DDos attacks on a target server by spoofing the source IP address. The existing botnet detection techniques rely on machine learning algorithms and do not expound the IF spoofing issue. These approaches are also found to be unsuccessful in the meticulous identification of the botmasters. Here we propose an architecture that depend on the PSO-based tracebacking. Our architecture also introduces the IP spoofing detector unit so as to ensure that the Traceback moves in the right direction. The approach also detects the zombies and utilizes the PSO optimization technique that aid in the identification of the C&C node. The experimental results show that our approach is successful in prompt detection of the bots.

AB This paper examines the contract interpretation strategies adopted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for its credit derivatives contracts in the Greek sovereign debt crisis. We argue that the economic function of sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) after Greece is limited and uncertain, partly thanks to ISDA's insistence on textualist interpretation. Contract theory explanations for textualist preferences emphasise either transactional efficiency or relational factors, which do not fit ISDA or the derivatives market. We pose an alternative explanation: the embrace of textualism in this case may be a means for ISDA to reconcile the competing political demands from state regulators and its market constituents. We describe categories of contracts susceptible to such political demands, and consider when and why textualism might be the preferred response.

TI London, Berlin, Moscow and Estonia's Coup of 1934
SO TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
AB The coup that took place in Estonia on 12 March 1934, which also meant the loss of democracy for Estonia, was a sharp conflict between internal forces in Estonia. Yet the force fields of the interests of three great powers the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Germany also intersected in Estonia. The communist Soviet Union, with a population 150 times larger than that of Estonia, and Nazi Germany, with a population 60 times larger than Estonia's, were considered threats to security in Estonia. The democratic United Kingdom, on the other hand, was considered Estonia's greatest friend and influential supporter. This article considers the attitudes and actions of these three great powers in 1933 and 1934.
   The United Kingdom had practically no interest whatsoever in influencing Estonian domestic politics and it is a known fact that it did not make a single attempt to do so. The reason for this was the low priority of the Baltic region in London's view. London was primarily interested in restraining Germany's influence in the Baltic region and in Estonia's domestic conditions only as far as they related to that background. Information concerning Estonia was deficient and policymakers in London most likely believed for some time prior to and after the coup that the members of the movement of veterans of Estonia's war of independence had close connections to Germany's Nazis, and Konstantin Pats and Johan Laidoner carried out the coup to prevent them from taking power.
   The limited steps taken by the Soviet Union's People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs aimed at supporting Pats in the election for Head of State turned out to be ineffective and were implemented too late, and thus did not improve Pats's chances to any significant degree. Economic leverage was not used. The Estonian Communist Party was a zombie organisation, which was a subordinate branch of the Comintern, which was in turn directed by the Kremlin. At best, the Estonian Communist Party could perhaps destabilise Estonia's domestic politics, but it could not direct it. The cooperation of Estonian socialists with Moscow doubtless exacerbated Estonia's domestic political situation but not decisively. Thus the Soviet Union's interference was not determinative in Estonia's loss of democracy.
   Even though there is less certainty concerning Berlin's policy due to a lack of available information, it appears that Germany's attempts to influence Estonia's domestic politics in its preferred direction were also limited in scope. Similarly to the Soviet Union, Germany's options were limited because Germany was also seen as a threat to security in Estonia, and Germany's threats or obvious attempts at "positive involvement" could have disposed the people against pro-German politicians altogether. In summary, the article concludes that the coup of 1934 was the result of Estonia's domestic political processes.

TI Zombie Linguistics: Experts, Endangered Languages and the Curse of
   Undead Voices
SO ANTHROPOLOGICAL FORUM
AB The alarming projection that up to ninety per cent of the world's languages will become extinct by the end of this century has prompted a new sense of urgency among linguists and other language scholars to rush out and record the last utterances from the last speakers of 'endangered languages'. As the last speaker utters her/his last words, the 'expert' is there to record this important moment and preserve it for all time. Among the benefits from such preservation efforts is the ability to play back the recordings at any time in any place. In popular media this process is described as 'saving the language' through recording and documentation. Unfortunately, these recordings are not living voices. Rather, they are zombie voices-undead voices that are disembodied and techno-mechanized. They are cursed with being neither dead nor alive. They become artefacts of technological interventions, as well as expert valorisations of linguistic codes. Expert rhetoric compounds the problem by the use of metaphoric frames such as death, endangerment and extinction. Metaphors not only frame discourses of language endangerment, but they also frame and influence actions and interventions. This essay critically evaluates the metaphors used by language experts to understand the unintended consequences for community members who are actively revitalising and reclaiming their languages. The essay also identifies key strategies used by community language activists to ignore existing metaphors, while creating new metaphors to potentiate new solutions to language death to promote emergent vitalities.

AB Wireless networks will provide much more convenience for mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, wireless networks also impose challenges on developers due to unknowing global electromagnetic environment information in each node, as well as diverse QoS requirements of various applications. Therefore, both correctness and reliability of communication protocol become extremely difficult. In years, model checking has been advertised as a way to ensure the correctness of complex protocols. In this paper, we present a formal approach of formalizing and verifying a distributed wireless communication protocol used for cooperative spectrum sensing. Lots of well-defined properties are then verified for the protocol model. By using the model checker SPIN, we have discovered some vulnerabilities in the protocol, which can make some nodes trapped into either false liveness or zombie status.

TI The Dirt on "Trash the Dress'' Resistance: Photographers, Brides, and
   the Mess of Post-wedding Imaging Sessions
SO CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION
AB Photographers, heterosexual brides, and news reporters associate "trash the dress,'' or TTD post-wedding photography sessions, with resistance. According to them, TTD changes cultural conceptions of weddings and the visual position of married women. In these sessions, women wear white wedding dresses while strolling in unconventional surrounds, jumping into the water, smearing mud on themselves, and acting like zombies. This detailed study of the ways TTD is associated with resistance, with an emphasis on photographers' practices, contributes to resistance studies and feminist literature by considering how opposition is promised and marketed. For instance, photographers promote TTD images as creative, alternative, and better than wedding photography in promotional blogs and other forums. Claims that TTD politically transforms weddings and women's experiences are in need of critique. Resistance, pleasure, and prestige are intertwined in this cultural activity. It is not completely apt to relate this practice to photographers' utter control of images and brides or women's absolute refusal of traditional wedding cultures. TTD sessions are reliant on the norm producing aspects of Western weddings and photographers promote and manage the oppositional functions of TTD in order to maintain their creative position. Yet, women trouble feminine roles when staining gowns and appearing to slide beyond social control.

TI Undead Spaces: Fear, Globalisation, and the Popular Geopolitics of
   Zombiism
SO GEOPOLITICS
AB In recent years, zombies have enjoyed a dramatic renaissance in various forms of popular culture. This essay argues that the current obsession with the walking dead, and particularly the looming threat of human-zombie conflicts, is a reflection of the dangers of invasive alterity associated with uncontrolled spaces in a globalised world. This shift is especially prevalent in the United States following 9/11, as zombies have become phantasmal stand-ins for Islamist terrorists, illegal immigrants, carriers of foreign contagions, and other 'dangerous' border crossers. Through three case studies which examine zombie 'outbreaks' on the local, national, and global levels, respectively, I discuss the importance of borders and geopolitical spaces in recent fictional depictions of humanzombie conflicts. As metaphors for illicit globalisation, zombies have emerged as a key pop-culture referent of the porous nature of socio-cultural, political, and physical boundaries in a global age defined by an emotional geopolitics of fear.

TI Physicalists Have Nothing to Fear from Ghosts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB It is well known that, according to some, philosophical reflection on zombies (i.e. bodies without minds) poses a problem for physicalism. But what about ghosts, i.e., minds without bodies? Does philosophical reflection on them pose a problem for physicalism? Descartes, of course, thought so, and lately rumours have been surfacing that has was right after all, that ghosts pose a problem for both a priori and a posteriori physicalism, and for any kind of physicalism in between. This paper argues that physicalists have nothing to fear from ghosts, since the central consideration employed to motivate ghostly arguments against physicalism - i.e. that ghosts are conceivable - is false: ghosts aren't conceivable.

TI Double movements and pendular forces: Polanyian perspectives on the
   neoliberal age
SO CURRENT SOCIOLOGY
AB In the neoliberal era, Karl Polanyi's notion of the 'double movement' has been widely deployed by social scientists as a critique of the prevailing order and a predictor of its demise. This article presents the double movement theorem, drawing upon Polanyi's published and unpublished writings. It explores parallels between his explanation of the advent of the 19th-century free-market regime in Britain and recent Polanyian accounts of the rise of neoliberalism. Following an analysis of the 'pendular' refunctioning of Polanyi's thesis, it closes by asking whether the recent global financial crisis heralds a pendulum swing from neoliberalism (or 'market fundamentalism') towards a form of socially coordinated capitalism, or towards 'more of the same'. As of 2011, it appears that neoliberal policy and ideology remain hegennonic, not in reinvigorated form but as an 'undead' policy regime, one that has spawned a burgeoning literature on 'zombie capitalism' and 'zombie neoliberalism'.

AB Crossmedia and transmedia share the multi-platform use of several formats to tell stories. The difference lies in the fact that, whereas the entire fiction is a product of the authors when using transmedia, by crossmedia the audience also participates in the making, sometimes even taking the place of the original authors. Throughout this article, we will analyse Lost Zombies as a crossmedia project in which the audience is the author, and Panzer Chocolate, a transmedia project in which the authors offer several options through different formats for the entertainment of the users. But we will not only consider entertainment: these new forms of communication can also be very useful to education. In this sense, Crocodox is a project for an interactive documentary for elementary students, still in the making. In a nutshell, this article presents the new possibilities crossmedia and transmedia give way to in a future that has hardly been outlined.

SO EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB Wade Davis's study of Haitian "zombification" in the 1980s was a landmark in ethnobiological research. His research was an attempt to trace the origins of reports of "undead" Haitians, focusing on the preparation of the zombification poison. Starting with this influential ethnopharmacological research, this study examines advances in the pharmacology of natural products, focusing especially on those of animal-derived products. Ethnopharmacological, pharmacological, and chemical aspects are considered. We also update information on the animal species that reportedly constitute the zombie poison. Several components of the zombie powder are not unique to Haiti and are used as remedies in traditional medicine worldwide. This paper emphasizes the medicinal potential of products from zootherapy. These biological products are promising sources for the development of new drugs.

AB Search optimization algorithms have the challenge of balancing between exploration of the search space (e.g., map locations, image pixels) and exploitation of learned information (e.g., prior knowledge, regions of high fitness). To address this challenge, we present a very basic framework which we call Zombie Survival Optimization (ZSO), a novel swarm intelligence approach modeled after the foraging behavior of zombies. Zombies (exploration agents) search in a space where the underlying fitness is modeled as a hypothetical airborne antidote which cures a zombie's aliments and turns them back into humans (who attempt to survive by exploiting the search space). Such an optimization algorithm is useful for search, such as searching an image for a pedestrian. Experiments on the CAVIAR dataset suggest improved efficiency over Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO). A C++ implementation is available.

TI Rethinking the role of top-down attention in vision: effects
   attributable to a lossy representation in peripheral vision
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB According to common wisdom in the field of visual perception, top-down selective attention is required in order to bind features into objects. In this view, even simple tasks, such as distinguishing a rotated T from a rotated L, require selective attention since they require feature binding. Selective attention, in turn, is commonly conceived as involving volition, intention, and at least implicitly, awareness. There is something non-intuitive about the notion that we might need so expensive (and possibly human) a resource as conscious awareness in order to perform so basic a function as perception. In fact, we can carry out complex sensorimotor tasks, seemingly in the near absence of awareness or volitional shifts of attention ("zombie behaviors"). More generally, the tight association between attention and awareness, and the presumed role of attention on perception, is problematic. We propose that under normal viewing conditions, the main processes of feature binding and perception proceed largely independently of top-down selective attention. Recent work suggests that there is a significant loss of information in early stages of visual processing, especially in the periphery. In particular, our texture tiling model (TTM) represents images in terms of a fixed set of "texture" statistics computed over local pooling regions that tile the visual input. We argue that this lossy representation produces the perceptual ambiguities that have previously been as ascribed to a lack of feature binding in the absence of selective attention. At the same time, the TTM representation is sufficiently rich to explain performance in such complex tasks as scene gist recognition, pop-out target search, and navigation. A number of phenomena that have previously been explained in terms of voluntary attention can be explained more parsimoniously with the TTM. In this model, peripheral vision introduces a specific kind of information loss, and the information available to an observer varies greatly depending upon shifts of the point of gaze (which usually occur without awareness). The available information, in turn, provides a key determinant of the visual system's capabilities and deficiencies. This scheme dissociates basic perceptual operations, such as feature binding, from both top-down attention and conscious awareness.

   (RETURN TO THE LAND AND THE FATHER'S ABSENCE IN DANY LAFERRIERES PAYS SANS CHAPEAU AND L'ENIGME DU RETOUR)
   In Pays sans chapeau and L'enigme du retour, the physical return of the narrator-protagonist to Haiti is associated with death, and hence to the body's ultimate return to the earth. In Pays sans chapeau, Vieux Os goes back to his native land after twenty years of absence and discovers a people of zombies of whom he wants to be the reporter. In L'enigme du retour, the return takes place thirty-three years after the initial departure. While the narrator's main objective is apparently to bring home the soul of his father, whose body is in New York, he also has the opportunity to take stock of his own existence, which bears a strange resemblance to his father's. This study of the two novels deals. with the exiled narrator's relation to his native country and to the satutary role of a body of writing dedicated to the primary question that inevitably haunts each new generation of Haitians : stay or leave.

AB We propose a framework that uses (external) environment information to enhance computer security. The benefit of our framework is that the environment information is collected by sensors that are outside the control of a host and communicate to an external monitor via an out-of-band channel (w.r.t. the host), thus it cannot be compromised by malware on a host system. The information gathered still remains intact even if malware uses rootkit techniques to hide its activities. Our framework can be applied for a number of security applications: (1) intrusion detection; (2) rate monitoring/control of external resources; and (3) access control. We show that that the framework is useful even with coarse-grained and simple information. We present some experimental prototypes that employ the framework to detect/control email spam, detect/control DDoS zombie attacks and detect misuse of compute resources. Experimental evaluation shows that the framework is effecting in detecting or limiting the activities of such malware. The growing popularity of multimodal sensors and physical security information management systems suggests that such environmental sensors will become common making our framework cost effective and feasible in the near future.

   We develop a main bank model where the main bank decides whether or not to raise additional funds from the capital market to continue to invest in a borrowing firm when nonmain banks withdraw funds. We show that the threat of withdrawal of nonmain banks is more likely to force the main bank to perform efficiently in handling troubled loans, thereby preventing problems with zombie firms, if the potential cash flow (liquidation value) of the firm decreases (increases) relative to the amount funded by nonmain banks. The theoretical results provide both efficiency evaluations for the renewal of the main bank relation in Japan after the end of the 1990s and empirical implications for the renewed main bank system.

TI STABILITY AND COMPETITION IN EU BANKING DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS: THE
   ROLE OF STATE AID CONTROL
SO COMPETITION POLICY INTERNATIONAL
AB The available evidence suggests that the European Commission's State Aid ("SA") control of public assistance to the financial sector in the European Union during the period 2008-2010 has had a positive impact on both financial stability and competition in the EU's internal banking market. The particular features of the crisis regime dedicated to assessing State Aid not only allowed the disbursement of unprecedented amounts of aid, often in record time, but also rendered the aid more effective by ensuring that aid recipients, where necessary, were restructured or liquidated. The conditions imposed on banks receiving large amounts of aid have generally led to highly significant restructuring and addressed fundamental weaknesses in business models, helping to avoid the creation of "zombie banks." At the same time, where aid amounts were relatively small and banks were sound, these rules allowed financial institutions to be aided without requiring changes in their business model.
   SA control has ensured that the large amounts of aid granted did not lead to major distortions in the Internal Market. Absent this control, these public interventions could have triggered a fragmentation of the Internal Market itself.
   While all substantial aid is likely to have a distortive effect, available indicators suggest that SA control has effectively mitigated these consequences. There is little evidence of retrenchment behind national borders and aided banks have generally not seen their market shares increase. Moreover, the crisis framework is likely to have had a strong signalling function to financial institutions with respect to moral hazard going forward.
   In the absence of EU-wide rules for bank resolution, the SA crisis regime also presently acts as the de facto EU-wide resolution framework. However, it is an imperfect tool resolution compared to a full-fledged regulatory framework that helps avoid recourse to aid in the first instance and can provide clear ex ante guidance for all market players (which in itself is confidence-enhancing).
   The re-emergence of serious tensions in the EU banking sector from the summer of 2011 onwards is largely linked to concerns about the sustainability of public finances in a number of EU Member States feeding through to concerns about assets on banks' balance sheets. To remedy this, stability-oriented macroeconomic--especially fiscal-policies are required, and appropriate regulation of banking is needed. A key challenge for State Aid control in EU banking, therefore, is to ensure appropriate coordination with regulatory and macroeconomic policies as they are further developed.

TI Zombie trouble: Zombie texts, bare life and displaced people
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
AB There has been a recent upsurge in texts featuring zombies. At the same time, members of western countries have become increasingly anxious about displaced peoples: asylum-seekers and other so-called illegal migrants who attempt to enter those countries. What displaced people, people without the protection of the state and zombies have in common is that both manifest the quality of what Giorgio Agamben calls 'bare life'. Moreover, zombies have the qualities of workers or slaves driven to total exhaustion. The genre of the zombie apocalypse centres on laying siege to a place that is identified as a refuge for a group of humans. In these texts it is possible to read an equation of zombies with displaced people who are 'threatening' the state. Indeed, the rhetoric used to describe these people constructs them as similar to mythical zombies. This article includes analyses of a number of zombie films including Shaun of the Dead, Fido and Undead.

TI The Uplands after neoliberalism? - The role of the small farm in rural
   sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB The modernist project foresaw no role for small farms, but this can no longer be regarded as axiomatic as neoliberalism enters what Peck et al. call its "zombie phase". This paper asks what contribution small farms in the uplands can make to societies' goals, what role they might play in the sustainability of rural communities in such regions, and how this contribution might be supported by state policies. In Scotland and in Norway these questions have recently been the subject of policy debates which appear to offer exceptions or alternatives to neoliberal universalism, and these are considered specifically in this paper. In each case support for small farms is seen as necessary to maintain 'lights in the windows' of remoter rural areas. Moreover, each highlights the vital role of the state in offering not only financial support but also in regulating land transfers and occupancy. It is argued that the dismantling of such regulatory powers depletes the state's ability to manage the tensions between continuity and change which are at the heart of sustainable rural development. The paper concludes that small farms can persist and can contribute to rural sustainability in ways that have been infrequently recognised under neoliberalism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Are survival processing memory advantages based on ancestral priorities?
SO PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW
AB Recent research has suggested that our memory systems are especially tuned to process information according to its survival relevance, and that inducing problems of "ancestral priorities" faced by our ancestors should lead to optimal recall performance (Nairne & Pandeirada, Cognitive Psychology, 2010). The present study investigated the specificity of this idea by comparing an ancestor-consistent scenario and a modern survival scenario that involved threats that were encountered by human ancestors (e.g., predators) or threats from fictitious creatures (i.e., zombies). Participants read one of four survival scenarios in which the environment and the explicit threat were either consistent or inconsistent with ancestrally based problems (i.e., grasslands-predators, grasslands-zombies, city-attackers, city-zombies), or they rated words for pleasantness. After rating words based on their survival relevance (or pleasantness), the participants performed a free recall task. All survival scenarios led to better recall than did pleasantness ratings, but recall was greater when zombies were the threat, as compared to predators or attackers. Recall did not differ for the modern (i.e., city) and ancestral (i.e., grasslands) scenarios. These recall differences persisted when valence and arousal ratings for the scenarios were statistically controlled as well. These data challenge the specificity of ancestral priorities in survival-processing advantages in memory.

TI Transposable element origins of epigenetic gene regulation
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Transposable elements (TEs) are massively abundant and unstable in all plant genomes, but are mostly silent because of epigenetic suppression. Because all known epigenetic pathways act on all TEs, it is likely that the specialized epigenetic regulation of regular host genes (RHGs) was co-opted from this ubiquitous need for the silencing of TEs and viruses. With their internally repetitive and rearranging structures, and the acquisition of fragments of RHGs, the expression of TEs commonly makes antisense RNAs for both TE genes and RHGs. These antisense RNAs, particularly from heterochromatic reservoirs of 'zombie' TEs that are rearranged to form variously internally repetitive structures, may be advantageous because their induction will help rapidly suppress active TEs of the same family. RHG fragments within rapidly rearranging TEs may also provide the raw material for the ongoing generation of miRNA genes. TE gene expression is regulated by both environmental and developmental signals, and insertions can place nearby RHGs under the regulation (both standard and epigenetic) of the TE. The ubiquity of TEs, their frequent preferential association with RHGs, and their ability to be programmed by epigenetic signals all indicate that RGHs have nearly unlimited access to novel regulatory cassettes to assist plant adaptation.

TI ZOMBIE STATES: RECONSIDERING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
   INSTINCTS
SO PSYCHOANALYTIC QUARTERLY
AB Where the dialectical relation of life and death instincts has become dissociated, zombie states result in which individuals inhabit deadness as if it were a full experience of aliveness. Bypassing reservations about the speculative nature of these instincts, this paper reconsiders their relation in order to highlight certain types of clinical phenomenology that could otherwise be lost to current ways of conceptualizing aliveness and deadness. A clinical vignette illustrates particular countertransference difficulties associated with dichotomizing issues of psychic aliveness and deadness, as well as the powerful contagion associated with what the author terms zombie states.

TI WDA: A Web farm Distributed Denial Of Service attack attenuator
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) attacks are familiar threats to Internet users for more than 10 years. Such attacks are carried out by a "bot-net", an army of zombie hosts spread around the Internet, that overwhelm the bandwidth toward their victim Web server, by sending traffic upon command. This paper introduces WDA, a novel architecture to attenuate the DDoS attacker's bandwidth. WDA is especially designed to protect Web farms. WDA is asymmetric and only monitors and protects the uplink toward the Web farm, which is the typical bottleneck in DDoS attacks. Legitimate traffic toward Web farms is very distinctive since it is produced by humans using Web-browsing software. Specifically, such upload traffic has low volume, and more importantly, has long off times that correspond to human view time. WDA utilizes these properties of legitimate client traffic to distinguish it from attack traffic, which tends to be continuous and heavy. A key feature of WDA is in its use of randomized thresholds that trap and penalize deterministic zombie traffic that tries to mimic human client patterns. WDA's heart is WDAQ a novel active queue management mechanism aimed to prefer legitimate client traffic over attacker traffic. With WDA installed, the attacker traffic toward the victim is attenuated. Extensive simulation results show that WDA can defeat simple flooding attacks, and can attenuate the bandwidth usable by sophisticated WDA-aware attacks by orders of magnitude. As a consequence, the attacker must increase his "bot-net" size by the same factor, to compensate for the effects of WDA. Our simulations show that WDA can defend a typical Web farm from DDoS attacks launched by hundreds of thousands zombies, while keeping legitimate clients' service degradation under 10%.

TI Hidden Diversity Behind the Zombie-Ant Fungus Ophiocordyceps
   unilateralis: Four New Species Described from Carpenter Ants in Minas
   Gerais, Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (Clavicipitaceae: Hypocreales) is a fungal pathogen specific to ants of the tribe Camponotini (Formicinae: Formicidae) with a pantropical distribution. This so-called zombie or brain-manipulating fungus alters the behaviour of the ant host, causing it to die in an exposed position, typically clinging onto and biting into the adaxial surface of shrub leaves. We (HCE and DPH) are currently undertaking a worldwide survey to assess the taxonomy and ecology of this highly variable species.
   Methods: We formally describe and name four new species belonging to the O. unilateralis species complex collected from remnant Atlantic rainforest in the south-eastern region (Zona da Mata) of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Fully illustrated descriptions of both the asexual (anamorph) and sexual (teleomorph) stages are provided for each species. The new names are registered in Index Fungorum (registration. indexfungorum.org) and have received IF numbers. This paper is also a test case for the electronic publication of new names in mycology.
   Conclusions: We are only just beginning to understand the taxonomy and ecology of the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis species complex associated with carpenter ants; macroscopically characterised by a single stalk arising from the dorsal neck region of the ant host on which the anamorph occupies the terminal region and the teleomorph occurs as lateral cushions or plates. Each of the four ant species collected - Camponotus rufipes, C. balzani, C. melanoticus and C. novogranadensis - is attacked by a distinct species of Ophiocordyceps readily separated using traditional micromorphology. The new taxa are named according to their ant host.

TI Traceback of DDoS Attacks Using Entropy Variations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a critical threat to the Internet. However, the memoryless feature of the Internet routing mechanisms makes it extremely hard to trace back to the source of these attacks. As a result, there is no effective and efficient method to deal with this issue so far. In this paper, we propose a novel traceback method for DDoS attacks that is based on entropy variations between normal and DDoS attack traffic, which is fundamentally different from commonly used packet marking techniques. In comparison to the existing DDoS traceback methods, the proposed strategy possesses a number of advantages-it is memory nonintensive, efficiently scalable, robust against packet pollution, and independent of attack traffic patterns. The results of extensive experimental and simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our experiments show that accurate traceback is possible within 20 seconds (approximately) in a large-scale attack network with thousands of zombies.

TI Spooks of Biopower: The Uncanny Carnivalesque of Zombie Walks
SO TOPIA-CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES
AB At a zombie walk, participants dress up as zombies and parade through the city performing a spectacular representation of a "zombie apocalypse."The popularity of these events has increased dramatically since the first recorded walk took place in Toronto in 2003. This paper considers the phenomenon in light of the Bakhtinian carnivalesque to argue that the modern zombie walk contrasts with older versions of carnival in its morbid suspension of life and death. I account for this mutation by referring to Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negris's concept of the society of control.

TI Varieties of Zombieism: Approaching Comparative Political Economy
   through 28 Days Later and Wild Zero
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PERSPECTIVES
AB This paper argues that the frequent references to zombies in analyses of the recent global financial crisis can be harnessed as a "teachable moment" for students of Comparative Political Economy. I claim that two zombie movies in particular-Britain's 28 Days Later and Japan's Wild Zero-can be viewed as if they were allegories of two different national forms of capitalism that are integrated into, and affect, the global political economy in different ways. While 28 Days Later displays remarkable similarities to Marxist accounts of the origins and dynamics of capitalism in England, Wild Zero can be seen as an account of the post-1985 dynamics of the Japanese political economy and its engagement with Asia. This paper gives concrete suggestions for the use of zombie films in the classroom. It concludes with the argument that these two films help to explain why references to "zombie capitalism" cross ideological lines.

TI Ta splanchna: A theopaschitic approach to a hermeneutics of God's
   praxis. From zombie categories to passion categories in theory formation
   for a practical theology of the intestines
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB It is argued that both the traditional clerical paradigm of an ecclesial approach and the phenomenological paradigm of an empirical approach are not sufficient enough to describe and maintain a theological methodology in practical theology. This has led to the introduction of a theopaschitic paradigm in theory formation. It is argued that the normative task of practical theology implies a philosophical-hermeneutical dimension, that is, to interpret under girding paradigms as related to meaning and being. It also implies a theological dimension; to reflect theologically on the praxis of God as an influential factor within human actions (inhabitational theology.) With reference to 'the pneumatological praxis of God', a practical theology of the intestines is proposed. Bowel categories reveal a divine intentionality (teleology) and describe a modus of God's praxis, the how of God within the vulnerability and suffering of human beings. This divine ontological mode should operate as a practical theological paradigm determining being qualities (ontic status) within human actions and processes of communication. The under girding theological presupposition is that ta splanchna [strong feeling of mercy and compassion expressed by the intestines] denotes a compassionate praxis of co-suffering (the passio Dei). Passion in practical theology emanates in parrhesia and instills a vivid hope: fides quaerens spem [faith in search of hope].

AB Anomaly based DDoS detection systems construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the network, and identify anomalies whenever traffic deviate from normal profile beyond a threshold. This deviation in traffic beyond threshold is used in the past for DDoS detection but not for finding zombies. In this paper, two layer feed forward neural networks of different sizes are used to estimate number of zombies involved in a DDoS attack. The sample data used to train the feed forward neural networks is generated using NS-2 network simulator running on Linux platform. The generated sample data is divided into training data and test data and MSE is used to compare the performance of various feed forward neural networks. Various sizes of feed forward networks are compared for their estimation performance. The generalization capacity of the trained network is promising and the network is able to predict number of zombies involved in a DDoS attack with very less test error.

AB Defeating botnet is the key to secure Internet. A lot of cyber attacks are launched by botnets including DDoS, spamming, click frauds and information thefts. Despite of numerous methods have been proposed to detect botnets, botnet detection is still a challenging issue, as adversaries are constantly improving bots to write them stealthier. Existing anomaly-based detection mechanisms, particularly network-based approaches, are not sufficient to defend sophisticated botnets since they are too heavy or generate non-negligible amount of false alarms. As well, tracing attack sources is hardly achieved by existing mechanisms due to the pervasive use of source concealment techniques, such as an IP spoofing and a malicious proxy. In this paper, we propose a host-based mechanism to detect bots at the attack source. We monitor non-human generated attack traffics and trace their corresponding processes. The proposed mechanism effectively detects malicious bots irrespective of their structural characteristics. It can protect networks and system resources by shutting down attack traffics at the attack source. We evaluate our mechanism with eight real-life bot codes that have distinctive architectures, protocols and attack modules. In experimental results, our mechanism effectively detects bot processes in around one second after launching flood attacks or sending spam mails, while no false alarm is generated.

AB Electronic mail (or email) has not just changed the way we communicate in our daily life; it has transformed the way we do business today. Considered a convenient, powerful and a low cost tool, it is widely used to convey all kind of information including -unfortunately - sensitive or confidential information such as passwords, personal data, and private information. In recent times, two emerging technologies, referred to as the cloud computing and browser-based email technologies, have gained popularity among users and, along the way, also added a new significant layer of risk: It is common practice now from users to store their passwords into email folders and even worse, most of those browsers store and remember your password to open your email account automatically. Let's imagine the consequences of an attack launched by cybercriminals designed to resend and divert the original functionalities and features inherent to the browser for any malicious purpose, or worse - terrorist attempts. Let's take for example a US military officer operating in a country at war such as Afghanistan simply sending emails to his family to keep in touch with them. Whenever he sends an email, thousands of emails containing racial slurs against Muslim people are automatically sent to Afghan troops from his web account without him knowing it. The consequences of such an action would be unquestionably devastating. This above example, though fictitious, illustrates how efficient this kind of emails could be for both war propaganda and deception operations against US troops. Now imagine a company 's decision maker who daily exchanges large amounts of emails containing sensitive or confidential information within and outside his company ranging from trade secrets, contracts details, customer lists, research reports, financial information to staff's personal details. Modifying the browser-based email technology could enable any ill-intended person to wiretap and to eavesdrop any email directly at the browser's level to record any sent data and to make them evade from the computer towards unscrupulous people. The collection of the daily flow of emails, both internally and externally, definitely provides a snapshot of a company's overall culture and is proving to be a powerful and efficient tool used for both industrial and economic espionage. As a last example, these technologies once modified, could be used to set up thousand of zombies in mail clients. For that purpose, a large number of email clients would simultaneously send thousands of mails to a single target - e.g. an email server - to deny mail service for a limited period of time. We can easily imagine that this kind of attack launched on any stock exchange computer systems would entail damaging economic repercussions for the affected country and would probably plunge it into chaos for some time. In this paper, we will explain and show that email can be used as a ideal weapon for terrorism, cyber warfare, espionage, denial of service and can cripple all sectors of economy and nation states. We will address these issues both at the technical and operational level. In any case, we have considered systems with the most restricted user's privileges, but making those attacks really easy and powerful.

AB Global Internet threats are undergoing a profound transformation from attacks designed solely to disable infrastructure to those that also target people and organizations. This alarming new class of attacks directly impacts the day to day lives of millions of people and endangers businesses and governments around the world. At the centre of many of these attacks is a large pool of compromised computers located in homes, schools, businesses, and governments around the world. Attackers use these zombies as anonymous proxies to hide their real identities and amplify their attacks. Bot software enables an operator to remotely control each system and group them together to form what is commonly referred to as a zombie army or botnet. A botnet is a network of compromised machines that can he remotely controlled by an attacker. In this we propose an approach using honeynet data collection mechanisms to detect IRC and HTTP based botnet. We have evaluated our approach using real world network traces.

TI The zombie's cogito: Meditations on type-Q materialism
SO PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Most materialist responses to the zombie argument against materialism take either a "type-A'' or "type-B'' approach: they either deny the conceivability of zombies or accept their conceivability while denying their possibility. However, a "type-Q'' materialist approach, inspired by Quinean suspicions about a priority and modal entailment, rejects the sharp line between empirical and conceptual truths needed for the traditional responses. In this paper, I develop a type-Q response to the zombie argument, one stressing the theory-laden nature of our conceivability and possibility intuitions. I argue that our first-person access to the conscious mind systematically misleads us into thinking that the distinctive qualities of conscious experience-qualia-are nonfunctional. Qualia, I contend, are functional, even though they do not seem to be. To support my claim, I introduce the "meditations'' of Rene Descartes' zombie twin. This establishes the plausibility of an appearance/reality distinction for consciousness and it undermines various anti-materialist objections based on privileged first-person access. I conclude that the best overall theory posits an appearance/reality distinction for qualia, and this, for the type-Q materialist, is decisive.

TI A NEW INTERPRETATION OF MORI'S UNCANNY VALLEY FOR FUTURE HUMANOID ROBOTS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION
AB Mori's graph and the uncanny valley concept that it includes is an invitation to us to think about the future integration of humanoid robots into their social environment. We propose a reinterpretation of Mori's graph based on a topological analysis which leads to respecifying each side of the uncanny valley and highlighting the key role played by the zombie figure at the bottom of the valley. In our approach, Mori's graph would be divided into a left-hand machine field whose beings are deprived of a soul, and a right-hand human being field. The uncanny effect attached to a highly biomimetic robot would find its origin in a cognitive dissonance faced with a machine felt to be too close to the bound between these two fields. Heider's balance theory is considered to specify the task dependency of the uncanny valley, which can be expressed by associating to the uncanny valley effect - and so to the uncanny valley depth according to Mori's graph image - a "balance degree" of the social situation in which the human-like machine is involved.

TI Motivating Children to Learn Effectively: Exploring the Value of
   Intrinsic Integration in Educational Games
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
AB The concept of intrinsic motivation lies at the heart of the user engagement created by digital games. Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.

TI Should I pitch my tent in the middle ground? On 'middling tendency',
   Beck and inequality in youth sociology
SO JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES
AB In 2009 Woodman has recently challenged youth sociologists concerned with inequality to evolve from what he describes as a middling orthodoxy that misrepresents the work of Ulrich Beck in an effort to emphasise the continuing relevance of class. In 2010 Roberts forcefully responds to Woodman, arguing that Beck's own words and empirical evidence contradict his argument. Woodman responds to Roberts, reasserting his position and asks for the debate to move beyond mere 'quote wars'. This paper engages with this debate, taking Woodman's challenge seriously while maintaining that Beck's jettison of class is problematic, and that the concept of class itself is still vital. The paper concludes with suggestions as to what youth sociologists concerned with socio-economic inequality might want to focus upon in the future.

AB Anomaly based DDoS detection systems construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the network, and identify anomalies whenever traffic deviate from normal profile beyond a threshold. This extend of deviation is normally not utilized. This paper reports the evaluation results of proposed approach that utilizes this extend of deviation from detection threshold, to estimate strength of DDoS attack using multiple regression model. A relationship is established between strength of DDoS attacks and observed deviation in sample entropy. Various statistical performance measures, such as Coefficient of determination (R2), Coefficient of Correlation (CC), Sum of Square Error (SSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Mean square Error (NMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (eta) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to measure the performance of the regression model. Internet type topologies used for simulation are generated using Transit-Stub model of GT-ITM topology generator. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation test bed for launching DDoS attacks with varied attack strengths. The simulation results are promising as we are able to estimate strength of DDoS attack efficiently with very less error rate using multiple regression model.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AD HOC AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING
AB In Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack, an attacker breaks into many innocent computers (called zombies). Then, the attacker sends a large number of packets from zombies to a server, to prevent the server from conducting normal business operations. We design a DDoS-detection system based on a decision-tree technique and, after detecting an attack, to trace back to the attacker's locations with a traffic-flow pattern-matching technique. Our system could detect DDoS attacks with the false positive ratio about 1.2-2.4%, false negative ratio about 2-10%, and find the attack paths in traceback with the false negative rate 8-12% and false positive rate 12-14%.

TI Semantics of Transactional Memory and Automatic Mutual Exclusion
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS
AB Software Transactional Memory (STM) is an attractive basis for the development of language features for concurrent programming. However, the semantics of these features can be delicate and problematic. In this article we explore the trade-offs semantic simplicity, the viability of efficient implementation strategies, and the flexibility of language constructs. Specifically, we develop semantics and type systems for the constructs of the Automatic Mutual Exclusion (AME) programming model; our results apply also to other constructs, such as atomic blocks. With this semantics as a point of reference, we study several implementation strategies. We model STM systems that use in-place update, optimistic concurrency, lazy conflict detection, and rollback. These strategies are correct only under nontrivial assumptions that we identify and analyze. One important source of errors is that some efficient implementations create dangerous "zombie" computations where a transaction keeps running after experiencing a conflict; the assumptions confine the effects of these computations.

TI The living dead? The construction of people with Alzheimer's disease as
   zombies
SO AGEING & SOCIETY
AB In the literature on Alzheimer's disease (AD), scholars have noted how both the disease and the people who are diagnosed as having it have been stigmatised. I argue here that the AD stigma is of a specific sort - it is dehumanisation based on disgust and terror. Although the blame for negative perceptions of people with AD has been placed on the biomedical understanding of dementia, I argue that strong negative emotional responses to AD are also buttressed by the social construction of people with AD as zombies. To illustrate this point, this paper identifies seven specific ways that the zombie metaphor is referenced in both the scholarly and popular literature on AD. This common referencing of zombies is significant as it infuses the social discourse about AD with a politics of revulsion and fear that separates and marginalises those with AD. It is in recognising the power of this zombie trope that its negative impact can be actively resisted through an emphasis of connectedness, commonality, and inter-dependency.

AB Research required in higher education coursework often fails to mirror the intellectual processes of those who are genuinely interested in areas of inquiry and develop passions they pursue across a lifetime. Those creative processes are remarkably similar whether engaged in by academics or by those outside the academy. Instead, students may encounter the same formulaic processes and products required in K-12 schools, with little opportunity to learn how to be genuinely engaged intellectually. Results of the United States High School Survey of Student Engagement (HSSSE) conducted with 81,000 students revealed that seventy-five percent reported being bored in class (Yazzie-Mintz, 2007). This is a worldwide problem. In a 2003-04 survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment of seventeen million fifteen-year-olds in thirty-two countries, forty-eight percent of them reported school boredom (OECD, 2004).
   This paper describes a culturally-sensitive autoethnographic research methodology called The Collectory based on the themes of fun in learning and related attentional skills of interest (Zinn 2004, 2008). The Collectory is a philosophical approach to research that puts the learner at the center of the exploration, broadening processes to include nontraditional sources, expanding product possibilities, and making the researcher's reflective, connective, and interdisciplinary thinking an integral part of the collection and presentation of information. It also allows for new models of expression, including "self-sponsored" writing. The Collectory research methodology integrates I-Search writing (Macrorie, 1988), multigenre writing (Romano, 2000), collage/montage representation (Weathers, 1980, in Romano, 1995), and scholarly personal narrative (Nash, 2004), and also nurtures skills of innovation identified in a large-scale six-year study of creative executives (Fryer, 2009).
   The Collectory is adaptable for use in multiple disciplines. In addition, satisfaction with the methodology is high; self-evaluation data collected over the past thirteen years from pre- and in-service teachers shows that eighty-nine percent of them believe these processes helped them engage more deeply in learning, providing skills they will practice themselves and use with their students. Wilkins-O'Riley Zinn began developing this approach as lead teacher in a high school dropout prevention program, drawing on previous media experience where creativity on demand and applied research were daily expectations. She continued developing it in university seminar where she taught the equivalent of Writing 121, 122, and 123, and continues her research in graduate education courses including human development, creativity, and educational research, building on insights gained while writing an autoethnographic dissertation exploring teacher/learner creativity (Zinn, 2004).
   Because Collectory processes require ongoing sharing and evaluation of information, they are active and participatory, and also encourage the development of intellectual community. Assessment of personal learning and information sources is transparent and reflective, making cheating nearly impossible. In an increasingly diverse and interconnected world, research must be presented as accessible and infinitely interesting, and must be nurtured as a creative skill of lifelong learning.

TI CONTEMPORARY ADAPTATIONS AND APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LIFE AND WORKS OF
   JANE AUSTEN
SO KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
AB Contemporary adaptations and appropriations of Jane Austen analyses the ways in which the phenomenon of literary and film adaptations and appropriations of Jane Austen's novels together with the phenomenon of the author's more or less romanticized biographies and their film adaptations shape the contemporary perception and understanding of Jane Austen's life and works. Taking Pride and Prejudice as an example, the author points to the frequency of the filmic, TV and literary adaptations of this most famous of Austen's novels. The author focuses on the recent appropriation of the novel in Seth Grahame-Smith's bestseller Pride & Prejudice & Zombies (2009) which introduces minor textual interventions that transform the novel's plot into a story about a zombie invasion and the Bennet sisters' struggle against it as ninja-warriors. The author suggests that the success of Grahame-Smith's novel owes more to the popularity of the classic's film and TV adaptations and the easy recognition of "Jane Austen" as a brand, alongside its symbolic capital on the global cultural market, than to new readings of the adapted text. Moreover, the author draws the attention to the discrepancy between the historical evidence about Jane Austen's unconventional life and opinions and the ideologically conservative and today globally recognizable brand of "Jane Austen". The roots of the latter are located in the Victorian appropriation of Jane Austen's life and works, whose sentimental and censored view of Austen we inherit. The author concludes that the zombific(a)tion of Pride and Prejudice by Grahame-Smith presents the most vivid illustration of the contemporary trend of adopting and appropriating Jane Austen, where a whole literary and film niche depends, in turn, on the fame and prestige of the author and her books and on keeping the works and the author alive.

SO ACTA THEOLOGICA
AB In this article practical theology is portrayed as a work-zone under construction. In order to understand the architecture associated with the construction work, the impotence of so called zombie categories and shell institutions are used to illustrate that practical theology needs to be re-constructed. This re-construction is being developed through reconsidering paradigm, epistemology and methodology operating within a relevant re-constructed practical theology. Theoretical principles are embodied in the use of the qualitative Delphi forecast method, documenting the consensus opinion of 10 informed participants on the possible role of spirituality within the workplace. Building on these accents, some markers are mapped for the further development of the so called recapitalisation of practical theology with emphasis on a possible meaning for the workplace. Future perspectives for the facilitation of spirituality in the workplace are mapped in conclusion.

TI Prosthetic white hyper-masculinities and 'disaster education'
SO ETHNICITIES
AB Critiques of Whiteness Studies paradoxically focus on embodiment whether this is whiteness as an embodied identity that has realist properties or the inscription of labouring bodies through a process of racialization. In this article I consider the ways in which whiteness may be best understood as a prosthetic that can situationally be attached/detached from white bodies. Paradoxically, this flexibility of whiteness increases white people's powers of symbolic and material control over environments and the bodies of people of colour. In earlier work I have considered prosthetic whiteness to be mostly associated with ruling class masculinities. However, in certain contexts this ruling class discourse may become generalized. To examine how situationally this might be the case I examine survivalist and preparedness literature ('disaster education') that considers the racialized other to be embodied, mindless, bodies ('zombies') and surviving whites to be disembodied, primal, heroic agents. Using popular culture, public information films and the recent preparedness information in the UK on 'swine flu' I show how people of colour are positioned as non-agentic, static and (most significantly) as immobile and risky bodies as opposed to the portrayal of 'white' subjects in preparedness as mobile and able subjects whose genetic survival is at stake.

TI Will the US bank recapitalization succeed? Eight lessons from Japan
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB During the financial crisis that started in 2007, the U.S. government has used a variety of tools to try to rehabilitate the U.S. banking industry. Many of those strategies were also used in Japan to combat its banking problems in the 1990s. There are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current U.S. crisis and the recent Japanese crisis. The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in 2003. From these unsuccessful attempts, we derive eight lessons. In light of these eight lessons, we assess the policies the U.S. has pursued. The U.S. has ignored three of the lessons and it is too early to evaluate the U.S. policies with respect to four of the others. So far, the U.S. has avoided Japan's problem of having impaired banks prop up zombie firms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to the renowned German psychopathologist, perceptions are corporeal and originate in the exterior objective space while representations are incorporeal and are derived from the interior subjective world. From his point of view, physicalness-imagination, exterior space-interior space', are absolute oppositions that permanently separate perception and representation by an abysm that allows no transition. For Amaral the confusion derives from the German word for perception "wahrnehmung", composed by the noun wahr (truth) and by the verb nehmen (take as). In this manner and according to the language, anything that we consider true is necessarily treated as a perception. Nothing is more natural that German thinkers would loose, from such terminology, some flexibility in the evaluation of the phenomenon. Amaral has also reminded that Wundt, in 1874, already distinguished between sensation where stimuli not yet differentiated are perceived; perception, when stimuli organize themselves in a more or less defined manner, and apperception, where an attribution of meaning and a comprehension of the perceived scene or situation occurs.
   Crick and Koch propose aspects of great relevance to understand the so called Neural Correlates of the Conscience. They propose that the main function of the sensory cortex is to construct and use feature or specific qualities detectors such as those activated for orientation, movements, and face identification. Therefore, we may affirm that most of the sensory and motor activities are already made and available in the entire cerebral cortex, in the manner of what Changeux has called previous global representations. The conscious qualification process of the different sensory hues and their progressive complexity is a progressive feature, which in the phylogenetic evolution leads to the Homo sapiens sapiens. In fact, in the so called conscious media promoted by the thalamo-cortical activation that is performed in a task that requires effort and attention, we find spontaneously co-activated neural structures coordinated in time and space of the previous global representations type, which in turn generate other processes in the CNS.
   Hallucination and delusions: Anankastic representations? Since the times of Esquirol, the definition that a hallucination is a perception without object remained unaltered. Only recently, Alonso-Fernandez questioned Esquirol's scheme upon affirming "a hallucination is anything but a perception without object, because it is not a perception and because it does have an object. Contrary to the sensoperception activity that goes from the outside to the inside, a centripetal psychic function by excellence, the hallucination is produced upon objectivizing a psychic image providing it with sensoriality and subsequently projecting it to the exterior, shortly an objectivizing projection with, a clear centrifugal transit. In addition, today it is accepted that hallucinatory phenomena exist in sane individuals, related to some personality traits among which the imagination must be highlighted.
   The topic of delusion has been the object of the most varied reflections. In our case, we are interested in studying the phenomenon whereby the delusion installs itself in the center of the patient's life as a mineralized representation of the world and of himself, until structuring most of his behavior and relations, which we propose to call anankastic representation. To understand the phenomenon, we believe fundamental Llopis' idea that nature does not possess different laws to produce similar phenomena, therefore, both the delusion and hallucinations observed in the different clinical entities must obey the same pathogenetic mechanism, whereby thought and perception disorders, in reality, are not different disorders qualitatively but only ways of expressing the different degrees of intensity in a disorder.
   From the psycho-physiological point of view, it must be underlined that what is activated in the hallucinatory phenomenon is a sensory network that carries a threatening signal for the patient, which is only possible because it is not under his superior control. Everything indicates that we are then dealing with representations that are presentified before a consciousness that does not recognize them as its own, because they have avoided the coincident mechanism of detection for afferent and re-entry signals that support the conscious perception, according to the findings revealed by contemporary neurobiology. That is a critical aspect of the debate on the manner in which neurophysiology must approach the topic of representations, the information storage, the engrams, and the recognition of memories constituting a person.
   Simulation and supervision processes intervene in the different states of consciousness that make global access to the past, present and future possible. The individual is not only the receptor of stimuli derived from the environment, to which he responds from his brain with the innate guidelines registered in his genome, but he is also an agent maker of new realities and conducts. He is a poietic and aulopoietic factor and because of that he has dignity. In the dialogue between genetic endowment and the environment and in the constitution of the epigenetic, consciousness and neuroplasticity are fundamental.
   In order for everything to function harmoniously, it would be necessary a balance of activity between the sensory cortex and the primary motor with the association areas scattered all over the cerebral cortex, and arranged from the prefrontal cortex. The constructs contained in previous representations must be reviewed in each opportunity and suffer some circumstantial arrangement or deep transformation, according to the case. We are dealing with a metacognition process through which the mind examines its own contents. Whenever a pathological situation alters this process, the constructs can become raw material for hallucinatory-delusional contents. The autopoiesis is interrupted and the mental dynamics is trapped by anankastic representations. Crick's zombies, Changeux's previous representation or Tellez's "timophanias", independent from the Self, imposed hallucinaiorilly and automatically on a conscience that cannot differentiate them from reality, constitute therefore a symptomatic expression of what we have called mental illness as ananke.

TI Realization of Call-Back Authentication (CBA) for secure web to cellular
   phone SMS communication
SO COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB In order to provide essential data services, the cellular networks have opened interface with Internet enabling communication with the users beyond the coverage of their wireless signals across the globe. Besides economical expansion of the global system for mobile communication (GSM) services, this interface has given birth to new security challenges. Especially recent research has divulged that an adversary equipped with little more than a cable modem can block all voice communication in a metropolitan area or even in entire country of the size of USA by sending enormous short message service (SMS) traffic via Internet. To overcome this threat in particular and other client-server communication problems in general, a new secure protocol, Call-Back Authentication (CBA), for web to phone SMS communication is proposed. The protocol introduces two-tier server architecture and pulls data traffic control (PDTC) mechanism for secure communication. The protocol is aimed to throat-knot malicious traffic at GSM-Internet interface gateway. The results show that the CBA protocol secures all GSM services from Internet originated SMS floods. Moreover the authentication mechanism of the CBA protocol identifies and blocks the spoofed as well as the zombie requests. The CBA server requires lesser resources to deliver SMS as compared to existing mechanism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SP Univ Teachers German
HO Univ Ulster
AB This article focuses on the demise of the GDR, not as is often the case by looking at how it is nostalgically remembered or retrospectively re-imagined, but more literally. Recent literature from the former GDR has been characterised by a fascination with death but also with spectrality; the revenant undead in the form of ghosts, spectres, vampires, and zombies. A notable example is the revival of the medieval 'danse macabre' in a series of contemporary 'Neue Totentanze' (2002). This preoccupation links with those recent poetological programmes that have focused on the archaeological excavation of memory, but also with the interest in time which has been noted by a number of observers. However, there is more at stake: an ironic take on Marx and the loss of ideals, a concern with work, an exploration of literature as 'postscript', and a fascination with epochal lateness which chimes with contemporary international interests. This paper will focus on lyric and prose texts by Volker Braun - Tumulus (1999), Auf die schonen Possen (2005) and Machwerk oder das Schichtbuch des Flick von Lauchhammer (2008) - to explore how the 'last words' of the GDR offer a political and aesthetic rejoinder to a depleted contemporary reality.

TI Zomian or zombies? What future exists for the peoples of the Southeast
   Asian Massif?
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY
AB Against the simplistic thesis that hill peoples are marginal and unruly groups by choice, in conflict with state power, this article shows that, in the context of mainland Southeast Asia, hill peoples develop relationships with lowland state societies that are more complex and ambiguous than usually portrayed. Ethnographic and historical evidence reveals that they compromise and cooperate with the lowland state more often than they oppose it. Although hill peoples are commonly conceived as 'barbarians' of the periphery, and ill-treated or instrumentalized accordingly, in some circumstances they played a central role in the defence and the reshaping of pre-modern and modern Southeast Asian states. Moreover, their political and religious acculturation by lowland societies sometimes proves to have been instrumental in the perpetuation of a specific identity under the guise of surface assimilation. This article not only highlights the dynamics of past and present interactions between lowland and upland societies but also questions the future of the latter, in the context of an increasing engulfment by nation-states and, conversely, of new perspectives offered by globalization. The analysis thus demonstrates that hill peoples often take advantage of new forms of partnership resulting from globalization to renegotiate their image and status more favourably, and to counter the pressure exerted by the dominant society. Finally, they appear to be neither Zomian - that is, uncompromising rebels to 'stateness' in James C. Scott's formulation - nor zombies, unable to adapt.

TI "Haitian Zombie, Myth, and Modern Identity"
SO CLCWEB-COMPARATIVE LITERATURE AND CULTURE
AB In her article "Haitian Zombie, Myth, and Modern Identity" Kette Thomas analyzes texts by Zora Neale Hurston, Alfred Metraux, and Wade Davis. In these narratives we are re-introduced to the zombie not as a metaphor for lost consciousness, but, rather, as a common system that replaces personal subjectivity with an influence alien to our natural development. The discourse on subjectivity has become a central focus in the modern era but attention to fiction in "third world" cultures is neglected because they are studied almost exclusively through historical, political, sociological, or anthropological lenses or because their collective identities leads scholars to assume they had not developed consciousness of individual subjectivity. "Third world" cultures, however, are addressing the subject and Thomas discusses the zombie as one expression that focuses on the validity of subjectivity. Further, although zombies have been part of the Western imagination for nearly a century, scholars have not studied the zombie in terms of its mythological components. The myth of the zombie reveals a process that combines the dynamic power of a leader, the community, and the individual or victim. Thomas's analysis emphasizes how zombification challenges the notion that there exists an invulnerable, continuous, self-possessed subjectivity in humans.

TI Dharma of the Living Dead: A Meditation on the Meaning of the Hollywood
   Zombie
SO STUDIES IN RELIGION-SCIENCES RELIGIEUSES
AB This paper examines the religious implications of the modern zombie, which has achieved great popularity in the modern Western imagination. Today's zombie-craze can be traced from its roots in Haitian folklore through the 1960s counter-cultural revolution. The popularity of the zombie reflects the after-effects of the anti-authoritarianism of the 1960s. As holes appeared in what Peter Berger called the sacred canopy, previously held systems of meaning collapsed, leaving a growing uncertainty about life and death. In many cases, these holes were filled by alternative spiritualities and Eastern philosophy. I will demonstrate, using Martin Heidegger, how the modern zombie acts as a vessel for Buddhist teachings. As such, the zombie's popularity can be understood as a reflection of a present need to confront mortality and thus become an "authentic being."

TI Breeding for behavioural change in farm animals: practical, economic and
   ethical considerations
SO ANIMAL WELFARE
AB In farm animal breeding, behavioural traits are rarely included in selection programmes despite their potential to improve animal production and welfare. Breeding goals have been broadened beyond production traits in most farm animal species to include health and functional traits, and opportunities exist to increase the inclusion of behaviour in breeding indices. On a technical level, breeding for behaviour presents a number of particular challenges compared to physical traits. It is much more difficult and time-consuming to directly measure behaviour in a consistent and reliable manner in order to evaluate the large numbers of animals necessary for a breeding programme. For this reason, the development and validation of proxy measures of key behavioural traits is often required. Despite these difficulties, behavioural traits have been introduced by certain breeders. For example, ease of handling is now included in some beef cattle breeding programmes. While breeding for behaviour is potentially beneficial, ethical concerns have been raised. Since animals are adapted to the environment rather than the other way around, there may be a loss of 'naturalness' and/or animal integrity. Some examples, such as breeding for good maternal behaviour, could enhance welfare, production and naturalness, although dilemmas emerge where improved welfare could result from breeding away from natural behaviour. Selection against certain behaviours may carry a risk of creating animals which are generally unreactive ('zombies'), although such broad effects could be measured and controlled. Finally, breeding against behavioural measures of welfare could inadvertently result in resilient animals ('stoics') that do not show behavioural signs of low welfare yet may still be suffering. To prevent this, other measures of the underlying problem should be used, although cases where this is not possible remain troubling.

TI A Wasp Manipulates Neuronal Activity in the Sub-Esophageal Ganglion to
   Decrease the Drive for Walking in Its Cockroach Prey
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: The parasitoid Jewel Wasp hunts cockroaches to serve as a live food supply for its offspring. The wasp stings the cockroach in the head and delivers a cocktail of neurotoxins directly inside the prey's cerebral ganglia. Although not paralyzed, the stung cockroach becomes a living yet docile 'zombie', incapable of self-initiating spontaneous or evoked walking. We show here that such neuro-chemical manipulation can be attributed to decreased neuronal activity in a small region of the cockroach cerebral nervous system, the sub-esophageal ganglion (SEG). A decrease in descending permissive inputs from this ganglion to thoracic central pattern generators decreases the propensity for walking-related behaviors.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We have used behavioral, neuro-pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to show that: (1) Surgically removing the cockroach SEG prior to wasp stinging prolongs the duration of the sting 5-fold, suggesting that the wasp actively targets the SEG during the stinging sequence; (2) injecting a sodium channel blocker, procaine, into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches reversibly decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, suggesting that the SEG plays an important role in the up-regulation of locomotion; (3) artificial focal injection of crude milked venom into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, as seen with naturally-stung cockroaches; and (4) spontaneous and evoked neuronal spiking activity in the SEG, recorded with an extracellular bipolar microelectrode, is markedly decreased in stung cockroaches versus non-stung controls.
   Conclusions and Significance: We have identified the neuronal substrate responsible for the venom-induced manipulation of the cockroach's drive for walking. Our data strongly support previous findings suggesting a critical and permissive role for the SEG in the regulation of locomotion in insects. By injecting a venom cocktail directly into the SEG, the parasitoid Jewel Wasp selectively manipulates the cockroach's motivation to initiate walking without interfering with other non-related behaviors.

TI Late Onset Autistic Symptoms and Other Fluctuating Behaviors
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICS
AB CASE: Suzanna was born to a 26-year-old woman who used cocaine, alcohol, and cigarettes and experienced domestic violence throughout her pregnancy. Suzanna was placed in foster care with her current adoptive family after her birth. Her initial evaluation at 4 years revealed a global developmental delay (physical: 6 months; social and communication: 12 months). Improvements in development seemed to be in response to subsequent interventions. At 5 years, she had borderline intellectual functioning, an expressive or receptive language disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
   Suzanna experienced an abrupt developmental decline at 6 1/2 years old. She lost cognitive abilities, and she no longer carried on conversations. Although she was no longer interactive with most people, she remained affectionate with her parents. Her mother thought that Suzanna had visual and auditory hallucinations. In addition, she developed encopresis and hand flapping. A neurological evaluation, including a test for Rett Syndrome, was negative. Her Full Scale IQ dropped from 73 to 50 with decreased adaptive functioning and clinically significant problems with hyperactivity, attention, and functional communication.
   Suzanna's development stabilized temporarily during an 18-month period. A second period of declining function included "zombie-like" behavior, anxiety, and hallucinations. Weekly sessions in child psychiatry included treatment with risperidone, methylphenidate, and supportive therapy for mother and child. After some clinical improvements in behavior, attention, and functioning, a psychological assessment confirmed the persistence of moderate mental retardation. A multidisciplinary team considered a diagnosis of childhood disintegrative disorder.

TI Zombies, Phenomenal Concepts, and the Paradox of Phenomenal Judgment

AB This paper explores the viability of rejecting a largely unchallenged third premise of the conceivability argument against materialism. Fittingly labeled 'type-Z' (for zombie), this reply essentially grants to the zombie lover not just the possibility of zombies, but also their actuality. We turn out to be the very creatures Chalmers has taken such great pains to conceive and more conventional materialists have tried to wipe off the face of the planet. So consciousness (at least for us) is a wholly material affair What is conceivable but non-actual are not zombies, but rather 'angelic' beings possessing an acquaintance with supermaterial phenomenal states. After showing how Chalmers' recent discussion of the phenomenal concepts strategy should incline those pursuing such a strategy toward a type-Z response, this paper relates type-Z materialism to similar replies that Chalmers has found 'hard to classify' and closes with a brief remark about how a type-Z materialist might reply to the knowledge argument.

They beg the question against physicalism in the sense that the argument will only seem compelling if one is already assuming that qualitative properties are nonphysical. To show this I will present the reverse-zombie and reverse-knowledge arguments. The only evidence against physicalism is a priori arguments, but there are also a priori arguments against dualism of exactly the same variety. Each of these parity arguments has premises that are just as intuitively plausible, and it cannot be the case that both the traditional scenarios and the reverse-scenarios are all ideally conceivable. Given this one set must be merely prima facie conceivable and only empirical methods will tell us which is which. So, by the time a priori methodology will be of any use it will be too late.

TI The Depiction of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Hindi Cinema
SO JOURNAL OF ECT
AB Background: There is little literature on the depiction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in movies. In India, Hindi cinema is an important source of public information and misinformation about ECT.
   Methods: We identified depictions of ECT in Hindi cinema through inquiries with e-communities, video libraries, and other sources. We also searched the PubMed database using search terms related to ECT and movies.
   Results: Between 1967 and 2008, 13 Hindi movies contained referrals to or depictions of ECT. By and large, the depictions were inaccurate, distorted, and dramatized. Electroconvulsive therapy was administered to punish, to obliterate identity, to induce insanity, and for other rarely clinically valid indications. Electroconvulsive therapy was almost always administered by force. Premedication was rare. Genuine ECT devices were uncommonly used. Electroconvulsive therapy stimulation almost invariably appeared to cause pain. Multiple shocks were frequently delivered in the same session. The convulsions were usually bizarre. The treatment caused mental disturbance, amnesia, weakness, and even a zombielike state, thought not mortality; clinical improvement was rare. There was no pattern of increasing accuracy of depiction of ECT with recency of movie release.
   Discussion: We examine the extent to which the identified inaccuracies are practically important and offer reasons for the inaccuracies. Although the inaccuracies are a cause for concern, we suggest that because Hindi cinema is generally hyperbolic, the public may be willing to distinguish real life from reel life when facing clinical decisions about ECT. Nevertheless, considering the potential for harm in the dissemination of misinformation, filmmakers should exhibit a greater sense of ethics when creating impressions that might adversely influence health.

AB It would be a mistake to deny commonsense intuitions a role in developing a theory of consciousness. However, philosophers have traditionally failed to probe commonsense in a way that allows these commonsense intuitions to make a robust contribution to a theory of consciousness. In this paper, I report the results of two experiments on purportedly phenomenal states and I argue that many disputes over the philosophical notion of 'phenomenal consciousness' are misguided-they fail to capture the interesting connection between commonsense ascriptions of pain and emotion. With this data in hand, I argue that our capacity to distinguish between 'mere things' and 'subjects of moral concern' rests, to a significant extent, on the sorts of mental states that we take a system to have.

AB Botnets have become a serious threat to Internet and are often deployed to control a large pool of zombies and perform notorious activities such as DDoS, information theft and spam sending. In this paper, a new method is developed for detecting IRC botnets by analyzing the characteristic of packet size sequence of the TCP conversation between IRC zombies and their command and control (C&C) servers. In comparison with IRC chat, the TCP conversations within IRC botnets show a nature of approximate periodicity defined as quasi-periodicity in this paper. A simple yet effective detection method is presented to detect IRC botnets by measuring the quasi-periodicity degree and packet average size of IRC conversations based on ukkonen algorithm. We evaluated our method using real-world IRC botnet traces captured from honeynet. The results show that our method can detect real-world IRC botnets from IRC traffic with high accuracy and has a low false positive rate.

AB As part of the Blind Programming Project at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, we are investigating ways to make programming more fun for school aged blind children. We are beginning this search by creating and empirically analyzing a number of different auditory computer games. These games are being analyzed to see if we can make them customizable (programmable), using blind programming environments, and to see what kind of strategies work best when designing video games in general for blind users.
   In this work, we explored the creation of a zombie-killing maze navigation game for the blind. Specifically, we were curious whether a sonar based system would be more fun for users when trying to navigate the maze as compared to a navigation system that literally told the user which way to travel. We hypothesized that the sonar system would be more fun, as it provided a playful challenge. Unlike most auditory games for the blind, which typically use screen readers, we made high quality voice recordings of the entire user interface for our game. Overall, results did not show that the sonar based game was more fun, however our game was rated so highly by users, that the navigation system itself appears less important than careful user design and innovative and fun auditory feedback.

In this study, we developed a method of monitoring behaviors of host-based processes from the point that a bot header attempts to make zombie PCs, detecting cyber attack precursor symptoms. We designed an algorithm that figures out characteristics of botnet which attempts to launch malicious behaviors by means of signature registration, which is for process/reputation/network traffic/packet/source analysis and a white list, as a measure to respond to bots from the end point.

TI From 'zombies' to 'coyotes': environmentalism where we are
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB Environmentalism is in trouble. Some denounce it for being 'depressing and dowdy'; others have announced its 'death'. Environmentalism faces three problems: the disconnection of 'the environment' as an intellectual concept from popular understandings, the broader development culture in which environmentalism is preached and the denial discourse it is popularly seen to spread. As a result, environmentalism is not dead but has become a 'zombie' category. Environmentalism can be reframed to enable more effective engagement with green practices by drawing constructive alignment between discourses of environmentalism and notions of fragmented and malleable identities. Doing so works towards a vocabulary of theory and practice that is sensitive to hybridity and contradiction, whilst retaining the utopian stimulus of conventional environmentalism. Drawing on the terminology of Haraway, 'coyote' environmentalism is one move towards a more productive framing of environmental practice.

AB It is becoming more common for researchers to find themselves in a position of being able to take over control of a malicious botnet. If this happens, should they use this knowledge to clean up all the infected hosts? How would this affect not only the owners and operators of the zombie computers, but also other researchers, law enforcement agents serving justice, or even the criminals themselves? What dire circumstances would change the calculus about what is or is not appropriate action to take? We review two case studies of long-lived malicious botnets that present serious challenges to researchers and responders and use them to illuminate many ethical issues regarding aggressive mitigation. We make no judgments about the questions raised, instead laying out the pros and cons of possible choices and allowing workshop attendees to consider how and where they would draw lines. By this, we hope to expose where there is clear community consensus as well as where controversy or uncertainty exists.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
AB This paper proposes a new line of attack on the conceivability argument for mind-body property dualism, based on the causal account of properties, according to which properties have their conditional powers essentially. It is argued that the epistemic possibility of physical but not phenomenal duplicates of actuality is identical to a metaphysical (understood as broadly logical) possibility, but irrelevant for establishing the falsity of physicalism. The proposed attack is in many ways inspired by a standard, broadly Kripkean approach to epistemic and metaphysical modality.

TI Imbodela zamakhumsha - Reflections on standardization and
   destandardization
SO MULTILINGUA-JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL AND INTERLANGUAGE COMMUNICATION
AB While the concept of standardization is well-established in linguistics, destandardization is a more recent addition to linguistic terminology. Drawing on historiographic and ethnographic data from isiXhosa, one of South Africa's indigenous languages, this paper reflects on both of these concepts. Standardization is discussed as a modernist grand narrative whose continued application to linguistic thinking has outlived its usefulness, and standard languages as such (hegemonoc, prescriptive, etc.) might be assigned to Beck's (2002) zombie categories of modernity. Discussing the example of brandy-talk in isiXhosa from the perspective of ethnographic lexicography (Silverstein 2006), the paper argues for a linguistic perspective which focuses on the articulation and reproduction of social meaning as a central mechanism in the formation of linguistic conventions or ways of speaking. It advocates a recognition of the practices of speakers as they draw on standard and non-standard forms, as well as their associated meanings and ideologies (first/second order indexicality), in positioning themselves as social beings with identities, histories, aspirations, and ideological stances in everyday talk.

AB In this review article I examine Michel Tye's recent reassessment of the phenomenal concept strategy. The phenomenal concept strategy is employed in the attempts to respond to the classical arguments that challenge materialism. I examine Tye's reasons for abandoning the phenomenal concept strategy (a strategy that he himself advocated in his earlier writings), and I examine the elements of his new position according to which the materialist response should involve 'singular when filled' content schema, as well as a version of the Russellian distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. In the final part I criticize the adequacy of Tye's theory not as a response to the dualists but rather as a response to opponents of representationalism from the materialist camp.

AB Widespread usage of broadband Internet connections has allowed the birth of a new threat against service providers and subscribers as well. Botnets are vast networks of compromised hosts under the control of single masters who possess the ability to launch crippling denial of service attacks, send vast quantities of unsolicited e-mail messages and infect thousands of vulnerable systems with privacy-violating spyware and other forms of malicious software. Our goal is to propose a distributed architecture and introduce novel algorithms for malicious (potential hot-net) activity recognition based on network traffic statistics generated by Net Flow. Scalability and robustness were the main principles during the design of the architecture. In this paper, we demonstrate that we are able to reduce the number of Net Flow records significantly with an own aggregation scheme. Furthermore, we are able to detect botnet participant computers (zombies) with the help of aggregated samples originating from various local networks, while the algorithms provide utmost anonymity to network operators.

AB We propose a framework that uses environment information to enhance computer security. We apply our framework to: enhance IDS performance; and to enrich the expressiveness of access/rate controls. The environment information is gathered by external (w.r.t the host) sensors, and transmitted via an out-of-band channel, and thus it is hard for adversaries not having physical access to compromise the system. The information gathered still remains intact even if malware use rootkit techniques to hide its activities. Due to requirements on user privacy, the information gathered could be coarse and simple. We show that such simple information is already useful in several experimental evaluations. For instance, binary user presence indicating at a workstation can help to detect DDoS zombie attacks and illegal email spam. Our framework takes advantage of the growing popularity of multimodal sensors and physical security information management systems. Trends in sensor costs suggest that it will be cost-effective in the near future.

The purpose of the attack is also changing from curiosity and showing-off to economic interest such as the DDoS attack against the competitor and accessing confidential information. This paper reviews the method of active protection from the secondary damage by bot infection (DDoS attack, spam sending, and personal/financial information stealing, etc.), by designing the advanced quarantine technique that extracts and blocks traffic from the botnet only, and based on the important information of the botnet.

TI Zombie geographies and the undead city
SO SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY
AB In this paper I explore the connections between zombie films and bodies-cities. Common critical and popular analyses of zombie films focus on the body of the zombie, but pay little attention to surrounding spaces. Zombie films of the past ten years are increasingly being set in cities, a trend that I argue allows for the transfer of the ambiguous identity of zombie bodies to city spaces. The zombie outbreak creates an 'other'-space that I term blank space in which previously rigidly codified spaces are subject to new constructions that reinscribe bodies with new, and potentially 'other', subjectivities. Through an analysis of six zombie films (Night of the Living Dead, Land of the Dead, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, 28 Days Later, and 28 Weeks Later), I argue that for geographers, zombie films can be read as expressions of a bodies-cities theory that emphasizes the role that spatial and bodily otherness plays in the constitution of bodies and cities. For bodies-cities theory, zombies offer a manifestation of the mutuality between bodies and cities that foregrounds corporeality while articulating the importance of difference and otherness for the constitution of bodies and cities.

   We propose that a fourth structural field concerning psychoneurosis is to be added to those of neurosis, perversions and psychosis. Melancholia is distinguished from depression from a psychoanalytic point of view, in the specificity of the timopathic field. This distinction between their unconscious dynamics is carried out using Freud's and Lacan's works. Melancholia is linked to the movement of the drive dimension, while depression is linked to psychic conflict. In both, the Ego is involved. In melancholia the subject has fallen in an abyss without bottom and in depression the subject, as a zombie, is always walking at the board of precipices.

AB CASE: Suzanna was born to a 26-year-old woman who used cocaine, alcohol, and cigarettes and experienced domestic violence throughout her pregnancy. Suzanna was placed in foster care with her current adoptive family after her birth. Her initial evaluation at 4 years revealed a global developmental delay (physical: 6 months; social and communication: 12 months). Improvements in development seemed to be in response to subsequent interventions. At 5 years, she had borderline intellectual functioning, an expressive or receptive language disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
   Suzanna experienced an abrupt developmental decline at 6 1/2 years old. She lost cognitive abilities, and she no longer carried on conversations. Although she was no longer interactive with most people, she remained affectionate with her parents. Her mother thought that Suzanna had visual and auditory hallucinations. in addition, she developed encopresis and hand flapping. A neurological evaluation, including a test for Rett Syndrome, was negative. Her Full Scale IQ dropped from 73 to So with decreased adaptive functioning and clinically significant problems with hyperactivity, attention, and functional communication.
   Suzanna's development stabilized temporarily during an 18-month period. A second period of declining function included "zombie-like" behavior, anxiety, and hallucinations. Weekly sessions in child psychiatry included treatment with risperidone, methylphenidate, and supportive therapy for mother and child. After some clinical improvements in behavior, attention, and functioning, a psychological assessment confirmed the persistence of moderate mental retardation. A multidisciplinary team considered a diagnosis of childhood disintegrative disorder.

TI Illegal Aliens' and the State, or: Bare Bodies vs the Zombie
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY
AB This article focuses on the opposite poles of what Agamben, following Schmitt, calls the state of exception: the irregular migrant as homo sacer and the sovereign state. It takes the practice of detaining 'illegal immigrants' as a starting point for reflection on two central features of debates about globalization: (1) the declining relevance of space and (2) the declining relevance of nation-states. The author argues that both may be taking place, but they are being countered by states adapting themselves to the condition of globalization. By turning itself from welfare state into penal state, the state seeks new ways of defining itself in a globalizing world. This involves the detention centre for 'illegal immigrants' as a space of exception. The author uses three notions in order to capture the nature of the space occupied by the detention centre, which escapes traditional social scientific notions of space. Ranging from the more 'formal' characteristics of the spaces in question to their full political substance, they are Auge's notion of the non-place, Foucault's notion of the heterotopia and Agamben's notion of the camp. The author argues that the global is networked through localities, and that the exceptional space of the detention centre for 'illegal aliens' is a political node in the global network. The incarceration of irregular immigrants as homines sacri is part of a response to the global by means of an absolute relevance of the local: the detention centre, which is at once the model of binding locality and the site of a space 'outside' regular social space.

TI Are you an honest scientist? Truthfulness in science should be an iron
   law, not a vague aspiration
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB Anyone who has been a scientist for more than a couple of decades will realize that there has been a progressive and pervasive decline in the honesty of scientific communications. Yet real science simply must be an arena where truth is the rule; or else the activity simply stops being science and becomes something else: Zombie science. Although all humans ought to be truthful at all times; science is the one area of social functioning in which truth is the primary value, and truthfulness the core evaluation. Truth-telling and truth-seeking should not, therefore, be regarded as unattainable aspirations for scientists, but as iron laws, continually and universally operative. Yet such is the endemic state of corruption that an insistence on truthfulness in science seems perverse, aggressive, dangerous, or simply utopian. Not so: truthfulness in science is not utopian and was indeed taken for granted (albeit subject to normal human imperfections) just a few decades ago. Furthermore, as Jacob Bronowski argued, humans cannot be honest only in important matters while being expedient in minor matters: truth is all of a piece. There are always so many incentives to lie that truthfulness is either a habit or else it declines. This means that in order to be truthful in the face of opposition, scientists need to find a philosophical basis which will sustain a life of habitual truth and support them through the pressure to be expedient (or agreeable) rather than honest. The best hope of saving science from a progressive descent into Zombiedom seems to be a moral Great Awakening: an ethical revolution focused on re-establishing the primary purpose of science: which is the pursuit of truth. Such an Awakening would necessarily begin with individual commitment, but to have any impact it would need to progress rapidly to institutional forms. The most realistic prospect is that some sub-specialties of science might self-identify as being engaged primarily in the pursuit of truth, might form invisible colleges, and (supported by strong ethical systems to which their participants subscribe) impose on their members a stricter and more honest standard of behaviour. From such seeds of truth, real science might again re-grow. However, at present, I can detect no sign of any such thing as a principled adherence to perfect truthfulness among our complacent, arrogant and ever-more-powerful scientific leadership - and that is the group of which a Great Awakening would need to take-hold even if the movement were originated elsewhere.

TI Illusions, Demonstratives, and the Zombie Action Hypothesis
SO MIND
AB David Milner and Melvyn Goodale, and the many psychologists and philosophers who have been influenced by their work, claim that 'the visual system that gives us our visual experience of the world is not the same system that guides our movements in the world'. The arguments that have been offered for this surprising claim place considerable weight on two sources of evidence visual form agnosia and the reaching behaviour of normal subjects when picking up objects that induce visual illusions. The present article shows that, if we are careful to consider the possibility that a demonstrative gesture can contribute content to a conscious experience, then neither source of evidence is compelling.

TI Chaos Theory Based Detection against Network Mimicking DDoS Attacks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB DDoS attack traffic is difficult to differentiate from legitimate network traffic during transit from the attacker, or zombies, to the victim. In this paper, we use the theory of network self-similarity to differentiate DDoS flooding attack traffic from legitimate self-similar traffic in the network. We observed that DDoS traffic causes a strange attractor to develop in the pattern of network traffic. From this observation, we developed a neural network detector trained by our DDoS prediction algorithm. Our preliminary experiments and analysis indicate that our proposed chaotic model can accurately and effectively detect DDoS attack traffic. Our approach has the potential to not only detect attack traffic during transit, but to also filter it.

TI Turning the zombie on its head
SO SYNTHESE
AB This paper suggests a critique of the zombie argument that bypasses the need to decide on the truth of its main premises, and specifically, avoids the need to enter the battlefield of whether conceivability entails metaphysical possibility. It is argued that if we accept, as the zombie argument's supporters would urge us, the assumption that an ideal reasoner can conceive of a complete physical description of the world without conceiving of qualia, the general principle that conceivability entails metaphysical possibility, and the general principle that for any s and t the metaphysical possibility of s & - t entails that s does not necessitate t, we have to conclude not that materialism is false but rather that either materialism or the "mental paint" (or "phenomenist") conception of phenomenality is false. And further, given the initial advantages of materialism, the fact that proponents of the zombie argument are not allowed to rely on arguments against materialism in confronting this dilemma, and difficulties with arguments in favor of phenomenism, we find ourselves pushed to reject the mental paint conception rather than materialism. Or at any rate, it is hard to see how the proponent of the zombie argument can carry the burden of proof that lies with her. Thus, whether or not those premises of the zombie argument are true, the argument fails to refute materialism.

TI Investigating the Role of Body Shape on the Perception of Emotion
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION
AB In order to analyze the emotional content of motions portrayed by different characters, we created real and virtual replicas of an actor exhibiting six basic emotions: sadness, happiness, surprise, fear, anger, and disgust. In addition to the video of the real actor, his actions were applied to five virtual body shapes: a low- and high-resolution virtual counterpart, a cartoon-like character, a wooden mannequin, and a zombie-like character (Figures 1 and 2). In a point light condition, we also tested whether the absence of a body affected the perceived emotion of the movements. Participants were asked to rate the actions based on a list of 41 more complex emotions. We found that the perception of emotional actions is highly robust and to the most part independent of the character's body, so long as form is present. When motion alone is present, emotions were generally perceived as less intense than in the cases where form was present.

TI Consciousness and Modal Empiricism
SO PHILOSOPHIA
AB David Chalmers supports his contention that there is a possible world populated by our zombie twins by arguing for the assumption that conceivability entails possibility. But, I argue, the modal epistemology he sets forth, 'modal rationalism,' ignores the problem of incompleteness and relies on an idealized notion of conceivability. As a consequence, this epistemology can't justify our quotidian judgments of possibility, let alone those judgments that concern the mind/body connection. Working from the analogy that the imagination is to the possible as perception is to the actual, I set forth a competing epistemology, 'modal empiricism.' This epistemology survives the incompleteness objection and allows some of our everyday modal judgments to be justified. But this epistemology can't justify the claim that Zombie World is possible, which leaves Chalmers's property dualism without the support it needs.

TI Delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction after general
   anesthesia
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
AB Background: General anesthesia is characterized by unconsciousness, analgesia, muscle relaxation, and depression of reflexes, generally in response to the administration of chemical agents that induce reversible unconsciousness. Study of the cognitive neuroscientific basis of general anesthesia involves evaluation of the effect of anesthetic agents on consciousness and the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive function. Central nervous system dysfunction after anesthesia and/or surgery can occur at any age but is a particular issue for elderly patients. Studies of delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have been published in many countries since the end of the last century. We present a discussion of delirium disorders and a review of the literature.
   Case Report: We also present case reports for 2 patients who underwent general surgery for epilepsy. The first patient experienced postoperative visual illusions, hallucination, and time and space disorientation. The second patient, experienced a postoperative zombie-like delirium state. The status of both patients was improved ill response to treatment with methylprednisolone. The first patient also received amantadine sulfate, and the second patient received antiepileptic drugs.
   Conclusions: The brain is the main target organ for anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and age-associated changes in the brain have important implications with respect to general anesthesia. Anesthetists and surgeons have suspected for many years that some patients suffer a postoperative decline in cognitive function. The condition generally has a good outcome because oxidative nerve cell derangements and neurotransmitter imbalances are transient.

TI VOODOO, ZOMBIES, AND MERMAIDS: US NEWSPAPER COVERAGE OF HAITI
SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB Newspaper articles in the United States paint a picture of Haiti as a failed state, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. These articles place the blame of the country's problems entirely on Haiti itself, with little regard for the outside forces that also contributed to the country's present-day state. This study is a critical geopolitical analysis of Haitian representation in U.S. newspapers. I empirically examine a year's worth of articles from 2004 written in five major U.S. newspapers. From these articles I analyze both the words used to describe Haiti and the emerging media frames. Critical studies have shown that representation in the media can greatly impact the conventional wisdom surrounding a place and legitimize social inequalities. By understanding the images used to describe Haiti, I hope to develop a means of rethinking popular perceptions of the country. I argue that only then can the problems of Haiti be more effectively addressed and a new dialogue created, one that encompasses the entire story of this Caribbean country.

TI Zombies and Epiphenomenalism
SO DIALOGUE-CANADIAN PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW
AB This paper examines the relationship between the claim that zombies! are logically/metaphysically possible and the position that phenomenal consciousness is epiphenomenal. It is often taken that the former entails the latter and that therefore any implausibility in the notion of conscious epiphenomenalism calls into question the genuine possibility of zombies. Four ways in which the zombist might respond are examined, and I argue that two-those most commonly encountered-are inadequate, but the others-one of which is rarely formulated and the other new-are more forceful. The upshot, nevertheless, is that the zombist may indeed face an unwelcome commitment to conscious epiphenomenalism.

This renaissance of the subgenre reveals a connection between zombie cinema and post-9/11 Cultural consciousness. Horror films function as barometers of society's anxieties, and zombie movies represent the inescapable realities of unnatural death while presenting a grim view of the modern apocalypse through scenes of deserted streets, piles of corpses, and gangs of vigilantes-images that have become increasingly common and can shock and terrify a population that has become numb to other horror subgenres.

AB Malicious botnet is evolving very quickly and using the many ways to evade detection system. The change of protocol is the most important part of the malicious botnet's evolution and evasion techniques. The initial malicious botnet was using the IRC protocol for communication between the command and contorl server and the zombie system. After that they use the HTTP protocol on the firewall-friendly and the P2P protocol to escape a Client/Server architecture. Because Many researchers studied malicious HTTP or P2P botnet for detection, the malicious botnet began to use the distorted communication method called HTTP2P. In this paper, we study the malicious HTTP2P botnet, and we will give to help malicious HTTP2P botnet detection by analyzing waledac botnet.

AB Any system during its lifecycle could be subject to internal or external accidental or malicious threats. Therefore attention to system security is very important nowadays. Security brings in concerns for availability, in addition to confidentiality and integrity. Many security assessment methodologies like ITSEC, CC and etc were used up to now, but most of them have some limitations for being used in design phase of systems. In this paper, simulation of a network system for quantitative security evaluation (QSE) based on discrete-event simulation (DES) by SimEvents is presented First, the system in normal state is simulated then an attacker is modeled as a client by means of zombies attacks to the system. Subsequently the availability of system begins to decrease. Finally the system cannot respond to the requests. After this simulation, the availability of system as an important security measure in any moment of simulation time is measured At the end, a case study of distributed denial of service (DDoS) simulation is presented and the availability measure of the system is evaluated.

AB Compromised machines are one of the key security threats on the Internet; they are often used to launch various security attacks such as DDoS, spamming, and identity theft. In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two-month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only 7 internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT.

TI A spam rejection scheme during SMTP sessions based on layer-3 e-mail
   classification
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB This paper proposes a scheme that rejects spam e-mails during their simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) sessions. This scheme utilizes a layer-3 e-mail classification technique, which allows e-mail classes to be estimated before the end of SMTP sessions at receiving e-mail servers. We analyze the proposed scheme using discrete-time Markov chain analysis under varying e-mail traffic loads and service capacities. This paper also considers the effects of e-mail retransmission and illegal spam relaying by zombie systems on the performance of the proposed scheme. Results from our analysis show that e-mail server loading decreases by using the proposed technique. This allows the reduction in non-spam e-mail queuing delays and loss probability. Our scheme also protects e-mail servers from being overloaded by spam traffic and, if performed collectively over the Internet, it is capable of performing outbound spam control.

TI GENETIC DISCOURSE IN MEDIA CULTURE: TEMPTATION BY COMMODIFIED
   IMMORTALITY
SO PROBLEMOS
AB Postmodernity is maintained as a stage of the development of capitalism. The difference between modernity and postmodernity is explained in relation to the new sphere of commodification and resourcification, namely, that of life and of all natural living processes. Postmodern media cult-Lire, or popular culture, is peopled by signs of immortality and various kinds of immortals - cyborgs, clones, zombies, immortal human beings and others. Thus, culture accustoms a consumer to immortals and immortality which is concidered as the main goal of a human being and evolution. By nano-bio-technologies and genetic discourse this goal is made scientifically valid, thus reachable. Genetic discourse is becoming the fundamental world-view providing focal landmarks for the emerging future. Media culture supports the spreading of genetic discourse and facilitates its understanding. The temptation by immortality can be considered as a version of modernist ideology of human liberation from various natural, social and heavenly bonds. This liberation, and also secularization, is supported by a scientific genetic technological discourse which is becoming a Stimulating factor of postmodern media production. The genetic explanation of the world is particularly handy for technological reflexivity: the entire world is as if encapsulated into human genes, which become the principle explaining the mystery of life, evolution and the future of humanity, thus rendering power to produce the human proper form and the future of people. All the possibilities stemming from the new genetic and biotech discoveries fell under the regulation of property relations by patenting, thus making "immortality" - as a temptation and brand not only an exeptional commodity, but also a political tool and a commodifying force. As the relationships of private property have penetrated natural biogenctic diversity and, having turned it into a resource, the cognitive subject has reached the goal to secularise the Universe, which lie has set for himself. only he as the owner and producer of genes lures people with the eternal shapes of the clones and their genetic information, which will be sustained in any location of the Universe. The temptation by "immortality" will become even stronger when the genetic code is mastered. The future of humanity is related to the mixed forms of life, trans-genic or otherwise genetically modified organisms and techno-human forms that will help to postpone, and later to conquer, death. Even thinkers with religious tendencies perceive the technological improvement of human beings as their evolution towards the techno sapiens and consider such a development as all advancement towards the Kingdom of God. The technologization of human beings is imagined in terms of their divination. Yet in this case the character of contemporary science secularising God and obliterating the perception of divinity is overlooked. Two versions of immortality are analyzed more closely - that of Z. Bauman, who links it with the development of computer technologies, and that of J. Baudrillard, who gives a warning that by cloning technologies humanity is trying to inverse the evolution and to return to the undifferentiated state of cells.
   The conclusion is drawn that regardless of how we understand 'immortality,' argue over its reality or unreality, all possibilities to prolong human life granted by genetics, informatics and other advances in science and technologies, which support the tempting idea of immortality, have already been penetrated by commodity relationships; therefore, "imortality" itself will be available only as a commodity.

AB This paper examines methods for protection of government organization websites on the focus of 7 . 7 Cyber Attack in South Korea. On July 7, 2009, twelve websites including the websites of Cheong Wa Dae, the National Assembly, the Ministry of National Defence, top internet portals Daum and Naver, and Auction in South Korea and fourteen websites including the websites of the White House and the State Department in the U.S. were attacked by DDoS collectively. The internet sites of South Korea and the abroad important government offices were attacked by DDoS for the first time simultaneously. Affected or zombie computers for themselves could attack the internet sites of important organizations and agencies.
   The first attack was that affected or zombie twenty three thousand PCs in South Korea at 6 p.m. of July 7, 2009 and two thousand PCs abroad helped to attack the websites of important government organizations and agencies. The second attack happened on July 8, 2009. Sixteen thousand zombie PCs were used at the second attack. The third attack was at 6 p.m. of July 9, 2009. Hard diskettes and data in "zombie PCs" which were affected by DDoS were destroyed from July 10, 2009. 7 . 7 Cyber Attack. Zombie PCs with malicious codes exploded for themselves from at least thirty thousand to the most sixty thousand zombie PCs. 7 . 7 Cyber Attack was happened by P Company in Seoul and D Company in Busan, South Korea. The two companies were consisted of file sharing sites. Methods for protection of cyber attacks might be considered as measures for level of citizen, for level of government organization, for state level and for level of inter-state level. Developed countries like the U.S. and Japan allocated 10 percent of the total budget even 10 years ago. South Korea was labeled an internet powerhouse, but ironically spent only I percent of its entire annual budget on cyber security. Budget for internet security in South Korea should be increased. Owners of all virus-infected computers should pay immediate attention to cleaning up their operating systems.

AB With the development of network application technology, there are tremendous viruses and trojans, especially botnet which has a great harm. It causes a large number of DDoS attacks and spread of spams. And some usual detection ways have their disadvantages. This paper proposes a method to detect zombie hosts based on analysis of initial parameters of the hosts sending mails.

AB We propose failure information analysis as a novel strategy for uncovering malware activity and other anomalies in enterprise network traffic. A focus of our study is detecting self-propagating malware such as worms and botnets. We begin by conducting an empirical study of transport- and application-layer failure activity using a collection of long-lived malware traces. We dissect the failure activity observed in this traffic in several dimensions, finding that their failure patterns differ significantly from those of real-world applications. Based on these observations, we describe the design of a prototype system called Netfuse to automatically detect and isolate malware-like failure patterns. The system uses an SVM-based classification engine to identify suspicious systems and clustering to aggregate failure activity of related enterprise hosts. Our evaluation using several malware traces demonstrates that the Netfuse system provides an effective means to discover suspicious application failures and infected enterprise hosts. We believe it would be a useful complement to existing defenses.

AB Zombie armies - or botnets, i.e., large groups of compromised machines controlled remotely by a same entity - pose today a significant threat to national security. Recent cyber-conficts have indeed demonstrated that botnets can be easily turned into digital weapons, which can be used by cybercriminals to attack the network resources of a country by performing simple Distributed Denial-of Service (DDoS) attacks against critical web services. A deep understanding of the long-term behavior of botnet armies, and their strategic evolution, is thus a vital requirement to combat effectively those latent threats. In this paper, we show how to enable such a long-term, strategic analysis, and how to study the dynamic behaviors and the global characteristics of these complex, large-scale phenomena by applying different techniques from the area of knowledge discovery on attack traces collected on the Internet. We illustrate our method with some experimental results obtained from a set of worldwide distributed server honeypots, which have monitored attack activity in 18 different IP subnets for more than 640 days. Our preliminary results highlight several interesting findings, such as i) the strong resilience of zombie armies on the Internet, with survival times going up to several months; ii) the high degree of coordination among zombies; the highly uneven spatial distribution of bots in a limited number of "unclean networks", and iv) the large proportion of home users' machines with high-speed Internet connexions among the bot population.

AB As modern life becomes increasingly closely bound to the Internet, network security becomes increasingly important. Like it or not, we all live under the shadow of network threats. The threats could cause leakage of privacy and/or economic loss. Among network attacks, the DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack is one of the most frequent and serious.
   In a DDoS attack, an attacker first breaks into many innocent computers (called zombies) by taking advantages of known or unknown bugs and vulnerabilities in the software. Then the attacker sends a large number of packets from these already-captured zombies to a server These packets either occupy a major portion of the server's network bandwidth or they consume much of the server's time. The server is then prevented from conducting normal business operations.
   In order to mitigate the DDoS threat, we design a system to detect DDoS attacks based on a decision-tree technique and, after detecting an attack, to trace back to the approximate locations of the attacker with a traffic-flow pattern-matching technique. We conduct our experiment on the DETER system. According to our experiment results, our system could detect the DDoS attack with the false positive ratio about 1.2% - 2.4%, false negative ratio about 2% - 10% with different kind of attack, attack sending rate and find the attack path in traceback with the false negative rate 8% - 12% and false positive rate 12% - 14%.(1)

TI Development as Zombieconomics in the Age of Neoliberalism
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB Development economics is currently dominated by an orthodoxy that is totally intolerant of alternatives and depends upon seeing both economy and society as based upon the incidence of market and institutional imperfections. This is characterised as 'zombieconomics' as it feeds in a reductionist and parasitical fashion on more widely cast and methodologically opposed methods, especially those associated traditionally with development studies and the old or classic development economics. This paper explains how this situation came about in the light of the evolution of economics more generally, and explores how development economics has become Americanised, more influential within development studies, policy- rather than critically oriented, and subject to an agenda increasingly set by the World Bank. It concludes by pointing to the challenges and the opportunities open to development studies as neoliberalism experiences a profound crisis to which the new development economics can only offer partial and piecemeal responses.

TI Chalmers' paradox
SO TRANS-FORM-ACAO
AB The Zombie Argument proposed by Chalmers, instead of working as a defense of dualism, banishes qualia to a 'world' where they cannot influence our judgments about ourselves. For this reason, according to the argument itself, we may be all zombies and not know it. This is what Chalmers called The Paradox of Phenomenal Judgment. The problem is that he accepts this paradox as part of his theory. This philosophical move, however, is not acceptable, for the paradox undermines Chalmers' theory, by showing that the zombie argument is, actually, an argument against dualism. Chalmers tries to solve this problem with many arguments based on the status of consciousness as brute indubitable explanandum. However, this attempt is a failure by a series of reasons showing that, even if he were right, we could still be zombies and not know it.

CL Paris, FRANCE
AB Inception stage of devastating attacks like DDoS attacks and botnet hosted attacks includes compromising numerous computers or networks over the Internet. The Port scanning tools are often used by the attackers not only to identify the vulnerable servers but also to identify the vulnerable network or vulnerable computers over the Internet. If the attackers can identify a single vulnerability then, with the use of malicious codes they can compromise that system and makes it a zombie. By compromising a group of computers the attackers can constitute the malicious botnet or zombie army. These are then used to perform a range of devastating attacks. One possible solution to curb the zombie army or malicious botnet is by detecting and blocking or dropping the reconnaissance scan, otherwise port scan. Numerous port scanning techniques are available today. To detect them all, one single algorithm is not sufficient so we derived a set of heuristics to detect the port scan traffic, even the crafty ones.

ZOMBIE PLANNING !!
---------------------------

First we consulted the Web of Science, downloading all articles with the key word "zombie". We received over 700 results. From this we created a csv and graphml file to analyze some key players in this topic area.

One approach was looking at the networks of the articles. Those that cited eachother may be talking about certain aspects of zombies or how to best naviagate a zombie world.
We plotted a network with weights below 4 and degrees below 6.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(igraph)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

setwd("C:/Users/Mgnwylie/Documents/INTEGFinal/Integ475Final/Networks")

network <- read.graph("C:/Users/Mgnwylie/Documents/INTEGFinal/Integ475Final/Networks/net.graphml", format = "graphml")

dat <- read.csv("C:/Users/Mgnwylie/Documents/INTEGFinal/Integ475Final/Data/dat.csv")

plot(network)

network <- simplify(network, remove.multiple = TRUE, remove.loops = TRUE)
network <- delete.edges(network, which(E(network)$weight <4))
network <- delete.vertices(network, which(degree(network) <6))

summary(network)

plot(network, edge.arrow.size=4, vertex.label=NA)
```

These are the top 18 articles we found in the subject area.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
V(network)$info
```

The articles had two main subject areas: philosophy and crime in south africa.


Article:

(This is done with our Zombie network at the below requirements)
network <- delete.edges(network, which(E(network)$weight <4))
network <- delete.vertices(network, which(degree(network) <6))
